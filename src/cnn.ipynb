      "What is depression? — Depression is a disorder that makes you sad, but it is different than normal sadness (figure 1). Depression can make it hard for you to work, study, or do everyday tasks.How do I know if I am depressed? — Depressed people feel down most of the time for at least 2 weeks. They also have at least 1 of these 2 symptoms:●They no longer enjoy or care about doing the things they used to like to do.●They feel sad, down, hopeless, or cranky most of the day, almost every day.Depression can also make you:●Lose or gain weight●Sleep too much or too little●Feel tired or like you have no energy●Feel guilty or like you are worth nothing●Forget things or feel confused●Move and speak more slowly than usual●Act restless or have trouble staying still●Think about death or suicideIf you think you might be depressed, see your doctor or nurse. Only someone trained in mental health can tell for sure if you are depressed.See someone right away if you want to hurt or kill yourself! — If you ever feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, do one of these things:●Call your doctor or nurse and tell them it is urgent●Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)●Go to the emergency room at your local hospital●Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:•1-800-273-8255•www.suicidepreventionlifeline.orgWhat are the treatments for depression? — People who have depression can get 1 or more of the following treatments:●Medicines that relieve depression●Counseling (with a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, or social worker)●A device that passes magnetic waves or electricity into the brainPeople with depression that is not too severe can get better by taking medicines or talking with a counselor. People with severe depression usually need medicines to get better, and might also need to see a counselor.Another treatment involves placing a device against the scalp to pass magnetic waves into the brain. This is called \"transcranial magnetic stimulation\" or \"TMS.\" Doctors might suggest TMS if medicines and counseling have not helped. Some people whose depression is severe might need a treatment called \"electroconvulsive therapy\" or \"ECT.\" During ECT, doctors pass an electric current through a person's brain in a safe way.When will I feel better? — Both treatment options take a little while to start working.●Many people who take medicines start to feel better within 2 weeks, but it might be 4 to 8 weeks before the medicine has its full effect.●Many people who see a counselor start to feel better within a few weeks, but it might take 8 to 10 weeks to get the greatest benefit.If the first treatment you try does not help you, tell your doctor or nurse, but do not give up. Some people need to try different treatments or combinations of treatments before they find an approach that works. Your doctor, nurse, or counselor can work with you to find the treatment that is right for you. They can also help you figure out how to cope while you search for the right treatment or are waiting for your treatment to start working.How do I decide which treatment to have? — You and your doctor or nurse will need to work together to choose a treatment for you. Medicines might work a little faster than counseling. But medicines can also cause side effects. Plus, some people do not like the idea of taking medicine.On the other hand, seeing a counselor involves talking about your feelings with a stranger. That is hard for some people.Is depression the same for teenagers? — No. The symptoms of depression are a little different for teenagers than they are for adults. Some teenagers are moody or sad a lot of the time. That makes it hard to tell when they are really depressed. Teenagers who are depressed often seem cranky. They get easily \"annoyed\" or \"bothered.\" They might even pick fights with people. Also, when treating a teenager, doctors and nurses usually suggest trying counseling first, before trying medicine. That's because there is a small chance that depression medicines can cause problems for some teenagers. Even so, some depressed teenagers need medicine. And most experts agree that depression medicine is safe and appropriate to use in teenagers who really need it.What if I take medicine for depression and I want to have a baby? — Some depression medicines can cause problems for an unborn baby. But having untreated depression during pregnancy can also cause problems. If you want to get pregnant, tell your doctor but do not stop taking your medicines. The two of you can plan the safest way for you to have your baby.It's also important to talk with your doctor if you want to breastfeed after your baby is born. Breastfeeding has lots of benefits for both mother and baby. Some depression medicines are safer than others to use while breastfeeding. But having untreated depression after giving birth can also cause problems, so do not stop taking your medicines. Your doctor can work with you to plan the safest way for you to feed your baby.More on this topic Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics) Patient education: Generalized anxiety disorder (The Basics) Patient education: Neuropathic pain (The Basics) Patient education: Seasonal affective disorder (The Basics) Patient education: When you have depression and another health problem (The Basics) Patient education: Serotonin syndrome (The Basics) Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Depression treatment options for children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Beyond the Basics) \n",

      "Diagnosis[change | change source]\n",
      "The ICD-10 is used around the world to diagnose people with illnesses like depression. According to the ICD-10, for a person to be diagnosed with depression, their symptoms have to last for at least two weeks. The symptoms must happen every day, or almost every day. These symptoms also have to cause problems in a person's life (like their work life, family life, social life, or other important parts of their life).[1]\n",
      "Usually, for depression to be diagnosed, a person must have five or more of these symptoms:[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "Depressed mood for most of the day (feelings of sadness, emptiness, and/or hopelessness)\n",
      "Teenagers may be irritable (they may get angry easily) instead of seeming depressed\n",
      "Feeling much less interested than usual in all, or almost all, activities; or not getting any pleasure from activities\n",
      "Significant weight loss (when not dieting) or weight gain (generally a change of 5% or more in body weight)\n",
      "Sleeping more than usual, or having trouble sleeping\n",
      "Moving around more than usual (psychomotor agitation) or moving more slowly than usual (psychomotor retardation)\n",
      "Feeling tired or not having energy, nearly every day\n",
      "Feeling worthless or guilty\n",
      "Not being able to think, concentrate, or make decisions normally\n",
      "Thinking a lot about death (not just being afraid to die)\n",
      "Most people who have not had depression do not completely understand its effects. Instead, they see it as simply being sad. Since it is not understood, many people criticize people with depression for not helping themselves.[source?]\n",
      "Some people with depression die by suicide. Depression is one of the mental illnesses that can cause a person to have suicidal thoughts.\n",

      "Prevalence[change | change source]\n",
      "This section does not have any sources. You can help Wikipedia by finding good sources, and adding them.  (September 2016)\n",
      "\n",
      "It is impossible to get an exact number of how many people have depression. There are many reasons for this. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "People may not admit to having depression, because of the stigma about depression\n",
      "Some people may not be correctly diagnosed with depression\n",
      "Different doctors and mental health workers may diagnose depression differently\n",
      "The number of people diagnosed with depression is different in different cultures, and among men and women\n",
      "In different cultures[change | change source]\n",
      "Major depression is one of the most common mental illnesses in the United States.[2] In 2014, 15.7 million adults in the United States had at least one episode of major depression. This is about 6.7% of all adults in the United States.[2]\n",
      "Around the world, depression causes more disability than any other mental health or behavioral illness, according to the World Health Organization.[2]\n",
      "However, the prevalence of depression is different in different cultures and countries.\n",
      "Prince (1968) found virtually no depression in most Asian and African countries. However, psychologists such as Zhang and Kleinman have found disorders with similar symptoms, but different names. For example, in the 1980s, Zhang found that in China, there was little mention of depression. However, instead, a disorder called Neurasthenia was far more common. When interviewing Neurasthenia patients, Zhang found that their symptoms matched the symptoms of depression by over 80%. While the term \"depression\" was practically unheard of in China, Neurasthenia could well have been a similar disorder – or the same thing.\n",
      "It is also important to take in different cultures ways of classifying depression. For example, in China, many people believe doctors solve physical symptoms, not mental problems. This may have made it more likely for \"depression\" to be diagnosed as a medical condition like \"Neurasthenia.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In men and women[change | change source]\n",
      "Typically, in most Western cultures, women are diagnosed with depression twice as often as men. However, men are often more likely than women to die by suicide.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "In children[change | change source]\n",
      "Depression in children can be harder to see. Children who are depressed may have a loss of appetite, meaning that they do not want to eat. They may also be clearly having more trouble in everyday life than before. For example, they may have sleep problems like nightmares; new problems with behaviour or grades at school; or be more irritable than usual.[4]\n",

      "Major depressive disorder is also referred to as major, biochemical, clinical, endogenous, or biological depression. It may also be called unipolar affective disorder.\n",
      "There are many subtypes of depression:\n",
      "\n",
      "Melancholia, or melancholic depression, is very severe (bad). It can cause many physical changes, like sleep and appetite changes. It can also cause a person to change their behavior - for example, by not wanting to be around other people.\n",
      "Psychotic depression is much like melancholia, but with hallucinations or delusions.\n",
      "Atypical depression causes anxiety and panic attacks.\n",
      "Chronic dysthymic disorder is a long-term, mild depression that lasts for at least two years. It often begins in adolescence and lasts for many years.\n",
      "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is when the depression seems to be related to the winter season. It usually starts in the autumn and goes away in the spring every year.  It is common in Alaska, Canada, and Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland), but not in Iceland.\n",
      "Causes of depression[change | change source]\n",
      "As of 2016, scientists believe there is no one cause of depression. There is a lot of argument over whether depression is caused by biological, cognitive, or sociocultural factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "Biological explanations of depression focus on changes in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters).\n",
      "Cognitive explanations of depression focus on how the way we think (cognition) affects our mood. These explanations say that if a person thinks negatively, this thinking can make them feel negatively about themselves and the world around them.\n",
      "Sociocultural explanations of depression blame stressful things like divorce, losing a job, bullying, and poverty for causing depression.\n",
      "The United States National Institutes of Health say that depression comes from the brain. However, scientists are still trying to find out exactly why it happens.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible causes[change | change source]\n",
      "There are many theories about what causes depression.  These theories include:[source?]\n",
      "\n",
      "Heredity (someone's genes): Depression often runs in families. However, people can get depression even if they are not related to anyone else who has it.\n",
      "Physiology: The amounts of some chemicals in the brain. Serotonin is the main chemical in the brain that has to do with happiness. Many antidepressant medications work by balancing the amount of serotonin in the brain.\n",
      "Psychological factors: Low self-esteem and harmful thinking\n",
      "Early experiences: Events such as the death of a parent or guardian, abandonment or rejection, neglect, chronic illness, and severe physical, psychological, or sexual abuse.\n",
      "Life experiences: Losing a job, homelessness, problems with money, death of a loved one, relationship problems, separation from a partner, being a victim of crime, or other life problems can cause depression.\n",
      "Medical conditions: Some illnesses, such as hypothyroidism, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or head injuries, may contribute to depression.\n",
      "Alcohol and other drugs: Alcohol can make people depressed. If a person abuses alcohol, benzodiazepine-based tranquillizers, sleeping medications, or narcotics, it can affect how long their depression lasts and how bad it is. Some medicines like birth control pills and steroids may also contribute to depression.\n",
      "Pesticides: Several scientific studies [6][7][8][9][10][11] have found statistical links between depression and some pesticides.\n",
      "Some depressed people also have other mental disorders, such as personality disorders and anxiety disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment[change | change source]\n",
      "Depression is usually treated with a combination of medication and other therapy. Good exercise helps deal with depression, since exercise releases chemicals that put a person in a better mood.[12] Having a supportive group of friends and doing outside activities can also help prevent or ease depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medication[change | change source]\n",
      "There are many medications that can help with depression. Many of these are called antidepressants. Examples of medications used to treat depression include:[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These are now the most commonly used type of antidepressant medicine. These drugs work by allowing the brain to have more serotonin. They have fewer side effects than older antidepressants. Examples include fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft).\n",
      "Tricyclic antidepressants. These are an older type of antidepressant. They are not used often today because they have many bad side effects and do not work as well as SSRIs.  An example is nortriptyline (Allegron).\n",
      "Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). They may be used if other antidepressant medications do not work well. This kind of medicine cannot be taken with many different foods and other medications.\n",
      "Sometimes, antidepressant medicine works better when it is used together with another drug that is not an antidepressant. These \"augmentor\" drugs include:[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "Tranquillizers and sedatives. These can help people sleep better and feel less anxious.\n",
      "Antipsychotics. These can help keep stop mood swings. They can also make hallucinations better, or make them go away completely.\n",
      "Lithium. This is a mood stabilizer often used for bipolar disorder, but it can also help people with depression.\n",
      "If people with depression do not take their medicine the right way, the depression can get worse. A doctor must help when they want to change to another medication, or to take a different amount of a medication than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychotherapy[change | change source]\n",
      "Psychotherapy is often a helpful treatment for depression.[14] In psychotherapy, a therapist helps a person to understand and solve problems which cause depression. The therapist also helps the person learn skills for dealing with their depression. [14]\n",
      "Psychotherapy can help a person make changes in the way they think, in order to help with life problems and understand what makes depression worse.[14] The most effective psychotherapy for depression is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).[source?] This teaches a person to think in a more rational, positive, realistic manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surgeries and procedures[change | change source]\n",
      "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), also called electroshock therapy or shock therapy, is used to treat a small percentage of severely depressed people. ECT uses a small amount of electricity to cause an epileptic seizure while the patient is under anesthesia. This may cause some memory loss (amnesia) or other side effects.[15]\n",
      "In the past, doctors used different ways of treating depression. These are rarely used any more. They include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Insulin shock treatment. The doctor would lower a patient's blood sugar so much that the patient would have a seizure.[16]\n",
      "Lobotomy. This is a form of surgery. The surgeon would use an ice pick or a surgical knife to cut nerves in the frontal lobe of the brain.[17]\n",
