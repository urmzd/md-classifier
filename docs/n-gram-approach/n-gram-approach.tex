\section{\MakeTextUppercase{Introduction}}
A recent study has found that approximately 89\% of patients across the United States
research their symptoms as a preliminary action prior to seeking professional advice.
Problems arise, however, when a series of articles the individual reads are contradictory.
This can create a sense of confusion and concern in the user.
In our research we will implement a solution to this issue by developing an algorithm that will,
based on the user's text description of their symptoms, classify the most likely ailment
they are experiencing.
