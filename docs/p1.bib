              and are the single most successful type of feature in authorship
              attribution. Their primary advantage is language independence, as
              they can be applied to a new language with no additional effort.
              Typed character n-grams reflect information about their content and
              context. According to previous research, typed character n-grams
              improve the accuracy of authorship attribution. This paper examines
              their effectiveness in three domains: authorship attribution,
              author profiling and sentiment analysis. The problem of a very high
              number of features is tackled with distributed Apache Spark
              processing.",

    abstract = "Methods based on deep learning approaches have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in a range of machine learning tasks and are increasingly applied to natural language processing (NLP). Despite strong results in various established NLP tasks involving general domain texts, there is only limited work applying these models to biomedical NLP. In this paper, we consider a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach to biomedical text classification. Evaluation using a recently introduced cancer domain dataset involving the categorization of documents according to the well-established hallmarks of cancer shows that a basic CNN model can achieve a level of performance competitive with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained using complex manually engineered features optimized to the task. We further show that simple modifications to the CNN hyperparameters, initialization, and training process allow the model to notably outperform the SVM, establishing a new state of the art result at this task.

abstract="Artificial Intelligence is becoming an important Computer Science field that is being leveraged periodically, to be collaborated with everyday applications. Health care is a major part of our lives and it is inevitable. It is not always easy to await a doctor's appointment to find out what the health problem or disease could be, for various reasons. The period of COVID-19 has especially been challenging in having access to doctors and hospital visits; despite minor health issues, people refrain from visiting medical institutions. chatbots have progressed to become quite handy in the medical industry for various purposes----predicting diseases, medications, pathology queries, and even just for general medical awareness at much lesser cost and resources. A conversational chatbot, like the one aimed to be created here, is a prototypical model for providing users a pre-diagnosis based on symptoms and concerns mentioned by the user. The model utilizes NLP and Neural Networks together, and Decision tree classifiers separately for two different ways of diagnosis. This can, therefore, assist users to get an initial idea and how to proceed about it further.",
