  abstract = "Character n-grams are widely used in text categorization problems
              and are the single most successful type of feature in authorship
              attribution. Their primary advantage is language independence, as
              they can be applied to a new language with no additional effort.
              Typed character n-grams reflect information about their content and
              context. According to previous research, typed character n-grams
              improve the accuracy of authorship attribution. This paper examines
              their effectiveness in three domains: authorship attribution,
              author profiling and sentiment analysis. The problem of a very high
              number of features is tackled with distributed Apache Spark
              processing.",
