abstract="Artificial Intelligence is becoming an important Computer Science field that is being leveraged periodically, to be collaborated with everyday applications. Health care is a major part of our lives and it is inevitable. It is not always easy to await a doctor's appointment to find out what the health problem or disease could be, for various reasons. The period of COVID-19 has especially been challenging in having access to doctors and hospital visits; despite minor health issues, people refrain from visiting medical institutions. chatbots have progressed to become quite handy in the medical industry for various purposes----predicting diseases, medications, pathology queries, and even just for general medical awareness at much lesser cost and resources. A conversational chatbot, like the one aimed to be created here, is a prototypical model for providing users a pre-diagnosis based on symptoms and concerns mentioned by the user. The model utilizes NLP and Neural Networks together, and Decision tree classifiers separately for two different ways of diagnosis. This can, therefore, assist users to get an initial idea and how to proceed about it further.",

The first task focuses on automatic detection of posts mentioning a drug name or dietary supplement, a binary classification. The second task is about distinguishing the tweets that present personal medication intake, possible medication intake and non-intake. We performed extensive experiments with various classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVMs, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) and deep learning architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), jointed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and LSTM architecture, and attention based LSTM architecture both at word and character level. We have also explored using various pre-trained embeddings like Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), Word2Vec and task-specific embeddings learned using CNN-LSTM and LSTMs.",
