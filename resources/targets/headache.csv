,Headaches,are,broadly,classified,as,"primary",or,"secondary".,[5],,Primary,headaches,are,benign,,recurrent,headaches,not,caused,by,underlying,disease,or,structural,problems.,For,example,,,migraine,,is,a,type,of,primary,headache.,While,primary,headaches,may,cause,significant,daily,pain,and,disability,,they,are,not,dangerous,from,a,physiological,point,of,view.,Secondary,headaches,are,caused,by,an,underlying,disease,,like,an,,infection,,,,head,injury,,,,vascular,disorders,,,,brain,bleed,,,,stomach,irritation,,,or,,tumors,.,Secondary,headaches,can,be,dangerous.,Certain,"red,flags",or,warning,signs,indicate,a,secondary,headache,may,be,dangerous.,[6],

,Primary,[,edit,],
,Ninety,percent,of,all,headaches,are,primary,headaches.,Primary,headaches,usually,first,start,when,people,are,between,20,and,40,years,old.,[7],,The,most,common,types,of,primary,headaches,are,migraines,and,tension-type,headaches.,[7],,They,have,different,characteristics.,Migraines,typically,present,with,pulsing,head,pain,,nausea,,photophobia,(sensitivity,to,light),and,phonophobia,(sensitivity,to,sound).,Tension-type,headaches,usually,present,with,non-pulsing,"bandlike",pressure,on,both,sides,of,the,head,,not,accompanied,by,other,symptoms.,[8],,Other,very,rare,types,of,primary,headaches,include:,[6],
,
,cluster,headaches,:,short,episodes,(15–180,minutes),of,severe,pain,,usually,around,one,eye,,with,autonomic,symptoms,(tearing,,red,eye,,nasal,congestion),which,occur,at,the,same,time,every,day.,Cluster,headaches,can,be,treated,with,triptans,and,prevented,with,prednisone,,ergotamine,or,lithium.,

,primary,exertional,headache:,throbbing,,pulsatile,pain,which,starts,during,or,after,exercising,,lasting,for,5,minutes,to,24,hours.,The,mechanism,behind,these,headaches,is,unclear,,possibly,due,to,straining,causing,veins,in,the,head,to,dilate,,causing,pain.,These,headaches,can,be,prevented,by,not,exercising,too,strenuously,and,can,be,treated,with,medications,such,as,,indomethacin,.,
,primary,sex,headache,:,dull,,bilateral,headache,that,starts,during,sexual,activity,and,becomes,much,worse,during,orgasm.,These,headaches,are,thought,to,be,due,to,lower,pressure,in,the,head,during,sex.,It,is,important,to,realize,that,headaches,that,begin,during,orgasm,may,be,due,to,a,subarachnoid,hemorrhage,,so,serious,causes,must,be,ruled,out,first.,These,headaches,are,treated,by,advising,the,person,to,stop,sex,if,they,develop,a,headache.,Medications,such,as,,propranolol,,and,,diltiazem,,can,also,be,helpful.,

,Headaches,are,also,very,common,during,episodes,of,,Cyclic,Vomiting,Syndrome,,(CVS),,which,in,the,past,was,called,'Abdominal,Migraine'.,These,episodes,of,constant,,non-stop,,and,extremely,violent,and,painful,nausea,and,vomiting,are,accompanied,by,many,symptoms,shared,by,migraine,headaches,,such,as,throbbing,pressure,behind,the,eyes,,visual,distortions,like,'Halos',,photophobia,,and,several,other,shared,symptoms.,,Much,like,migraines,,CVS,can,have,an,apparent,trigger,,which,sets,off,the,cascade,of,symptoms,,or,,more,frequently,,no,discernable,trigger,whatsoever.,Therefore,,during,episodes,of,a,CVS,attack,,many,sufferers,have,learned,to,tell,hospital,ER,doctors,and,nurses,that,they,are,suffering,from,'Abdominal,Migraine',,which,tells,the,treating,physicians,that,the,patient's,problem,is,neurological,in,nature,,and,not,,in,fact,,gastrointestinal.,This,also,alerts,staff,at,hospital,ERs,that,the,patient,may,require,a,separate,darkened,room,or,the,use,of,an,eye-mask,while,in,the,hospital,ER,waiting,area,,in,order,to,keep,the,episode,from,worsening,due,to,the,bright,lights,typically,found,in,hospitals.

,History,[,edit,],
,,,An,1819,caricature,by,,George,Cruikshank,,depicting,a,headache,
,The,first,recorded,classification,system,was,published,by,,Aretaeus,of,Cappadocia,,,a,medical,scholar,of,Greco-Roman,,antiquity,.,He,made,a,distinction,between,three,different,types,of,headache:,i),cephalalgia,,by,which,he,indicates,a,shortlasting,,mild,headache;,ii),cephalea,,referring,to,a,chronic,type,of,headache;,and,iii),heterocrania,,a,paroxysmal,headache,on,one,side,of,the,head.
Another,classification,system,that,resembles,the,modern,ones,was,published,by,,Thomas,Willis,,,in,,De,Cephalalgia,,in,1672.,In,1787,,Christian,Baur,,generally,divided,headaches,into,,idiopathic,,(primary,headaches),and,,symptomatic,,(secondary,ones),,and,defined,84,categories.,[46],
,
,Children,[,edit,],
,In,general,,children,suffer,from,the,same,types,of,headaches,as,adults,do,,but,their,symptoms,may,be,slightly,different.,The,diagnostic,approach,to,headache,in,children,is,similar,to,that,of,adults.,However,,young,children,may,not,be,able,to,verbalize,pain,well.,[66],,If,a,young,child,is,fussy,,they,may,have,a,headache.,[67],
,Approximately,1%,of,emergency,department,visits,for,children,are,for,headache.,[68],[69],,Most,of,these,headaches,are,not,dangerous.,The,most,common,type,of,headache,seen,in,pediatric,emergency,rooms,is,headache,caused,by,a,cold,(28.5%).,Other,headaches,diagnosed,in,the,emergency,department,include,post-traumatic,headache,(20%),,headache,related,to,a,problem,with,a,,ventriculoperitoneal,shunt,,(a,device,put,into,the,brain,to,remove,excess,,CSF,,and,reduce,pressure,in,the,brain),(11.5%),and,migraine,(8.5%).,[69],[70],,The,most,common,serious,headaches,found,in,children,include,brain,bleeds,(,subdural,hematoma,,,,epidural,hematoma,),,,brain,abscesses,,,meningitis,and,,ventriculoperitoneal,shunt,,malfunction.,Only,4–6.9%,of,kids,with,a,headache,have,a,serious,cause.,[67],

,Aneurysm,
,
,After,evaluating,the,results,of,your,headache,history,,physical,examination,and,neurological,examination,,your,physician,should,be,able,to,determine,what,type,of,headache,you,have,,whether,or,not,a,serious,problem,is,present,and,whether,additional,tests,are,needed.,
,If,possible,,try,to,write,down,how,you,feel,when,you,are,experiencing,a,headache.,Keeping,a,journal,of,your,headaches,and,how,they,make,you,feel,can,be,helpful,when,you,are,talking,to,your,healthcare,provider.,
,The,information,you,give,your,healthcare,provider,about,your,headaches,is,the,most,important,part,of,the,diagnosis,process.,By,giving,your,provider,as,much,information,as,possible,about,your,headaches,,you’re,more,likely,to,get,an,accurate,diagnosis,and,a,treatment,plan,that,will,help,you,feel,better.,
,Although,scans,and,other,imagining,tests,can,be,important,when,ruling,out,other,diseases,,they,do,not,help,in,diagnosing,migraines,,cluster,or,tension-type,headaches.,However,,if,your,healthcare,provider,thinks,that,your,headaches,are,being,caused,by,another,medical,condition,,there,are,several,imaging,tests,that,may,be,done.,A,,CT,scan,,or,,MRI,,can,be,used,if,your,provider,thinks,your,headaches,are,connected,to,an,issue,with,your,central,nervous,system.,Both,of,these,tests,produce,cross-sectional,images,of,the,brain,that,can,show,any,abnormal,areas,or,problems.,X-rays,of,your,skull,are,generally,not,done.,An,EEG,(electroencephalogram),may,not,be,needed,unless,you’ve,ever,passed,out,during,a,headache.,
,
,
,
,
Management,and,Treatment
,
,How,are,headaches,treated?,
,One,of,the,most,crucial,aspect,of,treating,headaches,is,figuring,out,your,triggers.,Learning,what,those,are,—,typically,by,keeping,a,headache,log,—,can,reduce,the,number,of,headaches,you,have.,,
,Once,you,know,your,triggers,,your,healthcare,provider,can,tailor,treatment,to,you.,For,example,,you,may,get,headaches,when,you’re,tense,or,worried.,Counseling,and,,stress,management,,techniques,can,help,you,handle,this,trigger,better.,By,lowering,your,stress,level,,you,can,avoid,stress-induced,headaches.,,
,Not,every,headache,requires,medication.,A,range,of,treatments,is,available.,Depending,on,your,headache,type,,frequency,and,cause,,treatment,options,include:,,
,Stress,management,
,Stress,management,teaches,you,ways,to,cope,with,stressful,situations.,,Relaxation,techniques,,are,helpful,in,managing,stress.,You,use,deep,breathing,,muscle,relaxation,,mental,images,and,music,to,ease,your,tension.,,
,Biofeedback,
,Biofeedback,teaches,you,to,recognize,when,tension,is,building,in,your,body.,You,learn,how,your,body,responds,to,stressful,situations,and,ways,to,settle,it,down.,During,,biofeedback,,,sensors,are,connected,to,your,body.,They,monitor,your,involuntary,physical,responses,to,headaches,,which,include,increases,in:,,
,
,Breathing,rate.,
,Pulse.,
,Heart,rate.,
,Temperature.,
,Muscle,tension.,
,Brain,activity.,,
,
,Medications,
,Occasional,tension,headaches,usually,respond,well,to,,over-the-counter,pain,relievers,.,But,be,aware,that,using,these,medications,too,often,can,lead,to,a,long-term,daily,headache.,,
,For,frequent,or,severe,headaches,,your,provider,may,recommend,prescription,,headache,medications,.,Triptans,and,other,types,of,drugs,can,stop,a,migraine,attack.,You,take,them,at,the,first,signs,of,an,oncoming,headache.,,
,Drugs,for,high,blood,pressure,,seizures,and,depression,can,sometimes,prevent,migraines.,Your,healthcare,provider,may,recommend,trying,one,of,these,medications,to,reduce,headache,frequency.,
,
,
,
,
Prevention
,
,How,can,I,prevent,headaches?,
,The,key,to,preventing,headaches,is,figuring,out,what,triggers,them.,Triggers,are,very,specific,to,each,person,—,what,gives,you,a,headache,may,not,be,a,problem,for,others.,Once,you,determine,your,triggers,,you,can,avoid,or,minimize,them.,
,For,example,,you,may,find,that,strong,scents,set,you,off.,Avoiding,perfumes,and,scented,products,can,make,a,big,difference,in,how,many,headaches,you,have.,The,same,goes,for,other,common,triggers,like,troublesome,foods,,lack,of,sleep,and,poor,posture.,
,Many,people,,however,,are,not,able,to,avoid,triggers,or,are,unable,to,identify,triggers.,In,that,case,,a,more,personalized,multidisciplinary,approach,with,a,headache,specialist,is,often,necessary.,
,
,
,
,
Outlook,/,Prognosis
,
,Can,headaches,or,migraines,be,cured?,
,Treating,health,problems,that,cause,headaches,,such,as,high,blood,pressure,,can,eliminate,head,pain.,Recently,,there,have,been,several,new,advancements,in,our,understanding,of,what,causes,headaches.,Although,we,are,closer,than,ever,before,to,a,cure,,at,this,time,there,is,no,cure,for,primary,headaches.,Treatment,focuses,on,relieving,symptoms,and,preventing,future,episodes.,
,
,
,
,
Living,With
,
,What,if,treatment,doesn’t,work?,
,There,are,many,different,ways,to,address,headaches.,When,you,start,a,treatment,program,,keep,track,of,your,results.,A,headache,log,can,help,you,measure,progress.,
,Ask,yourself:,,
,
,Are,my,headaches,less,frequent?,,
,Are,they,less,severe?,,
,Do,they,go,away,faster?,,
,
,If,you,don’t,notice,an,improvement,,talk,to,your,doctor,at,the,next,follow-up,exam.,You,may,need,to,try,something,new.,,
,When,should,I,see,my,healthcare,provider?,
,Most,of,the,time,headaches,,although,painful,,don’t,pose,a,serious,threat.,However,,headaches,can,sometimes,be,a,symptom,of,a,life-threatening,condition.,Signs,you,should,seek,immediate,medical,care,include:,

,Understanding,what,causes,headaches,and,finding,treatments,to,relieve,the,pain,
,
,Nearly,everyone,has,had,headache,pain,,and,most,of,us,have,had,it,many,times.,A,minor,headache,is,little,more,than,a,nuisance,that's,relieved,by,an,over-the-counter,pain,reliever,,some,food,or,coffee,,or,a,short,rest.,But,if,your,headache,is,severe,or,unusual,,you,might,worry,about,stroke,,a,tumor,,or,a,blood,clot.,Fortunately,,such,problems,are,rare.,Still,,you,should,know ,when,a,headache,needs,urgent,care, and,how,to,control,the,vast,majority,of,headaches,that,are,not,threatening,to,your,health.,
,What,causes,headaches?,
,Doctors,don't,fully,understand,what ,causes,most,headaches,.,They,do,know,that,the,brain,tissue,and,the,skull,are,never,responsible,since,they,don't,have,nerves,that,register,pain.,But,the,blood,vessels,in,the,head,and,neck,can,signal,pain,,as,can,the,tissues,that,surround,the,brain,and,some,major,nerves,that,originate,in,the,brain.,The,scalp,,sinuses,,teeth,,and,muscles,and,joints,of,the,neck,can,also,cause,head,pain.,
,When,to,worry,about,a,headache,
,You,can,take,care,of,many,types,of,headaches,by,yourself,,and,your,doctor,can,give,you,medication,to,control,most,of,the,tougher,headaches.,But,some,headaches,call,for,prompt,medical,care.,Here,are,some,warning,signs,for,when,you,should,worry,about,headaches:,
,
,Headaches,that,first,develop,after,age,50,
,A,major,change,in,the,pattern,of,your,headaches,
,An,unusually,severe,headache,
,Head,pain,that,increases,with,coughing,or,movement,
,Headaches,that,get,steadily,worse,
,Changes,in,personality,or,mental,function,
,Headaches,that,are,accompanied,by,fever,,stiff,neck,,confusion,,decreased,alertness,or,memory,,or,neurological,symptoms,such,as,visual,disturbances,,slurred,speech,,weakness,,numbness,,or,seizures,
,Headaches,that,are,accompanied,by,a,painful,red,eye,
,Headaches,that,are,accompanied,by,pain,and,tenderness,near,the,temples,
,Headaches,after,a,blow,to,the,head,
,Headaches,that,prevent,normal,daily,activities,
,Headaches,that,come,on,abruptly,,especially,if,they,wake,you,up,
,Headaches,in,patients,with,cancer,or,impaired,immune,systems,
,
,Types,of,headaches,
,There,are,more,than,300 ,types,of,headaches,,,but,only,about,10%,of,headaches,have,a,known,cause.,The,others,are,called,primary,headaches.,Here,is,a,rundown,on,some,major,primary,headaches.,
,Tension,headaches,
,Occurring,in,about,three,of,every,four,adults,,,tension,headaches,,are,the,most,common,of,all,headaches.,In,most,cases,,they,are,mild,to,moderate,in,severity,and,occur,infrequently.,But,a,few,people,get,severe,tension,headaches,,and,some,are,troubled,by,them,for,three,or,four,times,a,week.,
,The,typical,tension,headache,produces,a,dull,,squeezing,pain,on,both,sides,of,the,head.,People,with,strong,tension,headaches,may,feel,like,their,head,is,in,a,vise.,The,shoulders,and,neck,can,also,ache.,Some,tension,headaches,are,triggered,by,fatigue,,emotional,stress,,or,problems,involving,the,muscles,or,joints,of,the,neck,or,jaw.,Most,last,for,20,minutes,to,two,hours.,
,If,you,get,occasional,tension-type,headaches,,you,can,take,care,of,them,yourself.,Over-the-counter,pain,relievers,such,as,acetaminophen,(Tylenol,,other,brands),and,nonsteroidal,anti-inflammatories,(NSAIDs),such,as,aspirin,,naproxen,(Aleve,,other,brands),,or,ibuprofen,(Motrin,,Advil,,other,brands),often,do,the,trick,,but,follow,the,directions,on,the,label,,and,never,take,more,than,you,should.,A,heating,pad,or,warm,shower,may,help;,some,people,feel,better,with,a,short,nap,or,light,snack.,
,If,you,get,frequent,tension-type,headaches,,try,to,identify,triggers,so,you,can,avoid,them.,Don't,get,overtired,or,skip,meals.,Learn,relaxation,techniques;,,yoga,,is,particularly,helpful,because,it,can,relax,both,your,mind,and,your,neck,muscles.,If,you,clench,your,jaw,or,grind,your,teeth,at,night,,a,bite,plate,may,help.,
,If,you,need,more,help,,your,doctor,may,prescribe,a,stronger,pain,medication,or,a,muscle,relaxant,to,control,headache,pain.,Many,people,with,recurrent,tension-type,headaches,can,prevent,attacks,by,taking,a,tricyclic,antidepressant,such,as,amitriptyline,(Elavil,,generic).,Fortunately,,most,people,with,tension-type,headaches,will,do,very,well,with,simpler,programs.,
,Migraine,
,Migraines, occur,less,often,than,tension,headaches,,but,they,are,usually,much,more,severe.,They,are,two,to,three,times,more,common,in,women,than,men,,but,that's,small,consolation,if,you,are,among,the,6%,to,8%,of,all,men,who,have,migraines.,And,since,a,Harvard,study,of,20,084,men,age,40,to,84,reported,that,having,migraines,boosts,the,risk,of,heart,attacks,by,42%, ,men,with,migraines, should,take,their,headaches,to,heart.,
,Neurologists,believe,that,migraines,are,caused,by,changes,in,the,brain's,blood,flow,and,nerve,cell,activity.,Genetics,play,a,role,since,70%,of,migraine,victims,have,at,least,one,close,relative,with,the,problem.,
,Migraine,triggers., Although,a,migraine,can,come,on,without,warning,,it,is,often,set,off,by,a,trigger.,The,things,that,set,off,a,migraine,vary,from,person,to,person,,but,a,migraine,sufferer,usually,remains,sensitive,to,the,same,triggers.,The,table,lists,some,of,the,most,common,ones.,
,
,
,
,
,Major,migraine,triggers,
,
,Changing,weather:,rising,humidity,,heat,
,Lack,of,sleep,or,oversleeping,
,Fatigue,
,Emotional,stress,
,Sensory,triggers:,bright,or,flickering,lights,,loud,noises,,strong,smells,
,Dietary,triggers:
				,
,missing,a,meal,
,alcohol,,especially,red,wine,
,chocolate,
,nitrates,in,cured,meats,and,fish,
,aged,cheese,
,an,increase,or,decrease,in,caffeine,
,MSG,(often,present,in,Asian,and,prepared,foods),

,Migraine,symptoms., Migraines,often,begin,in,the,evening,or,during,sleep.,In,some,people,,the,attacks,are,preceded,by,several,hours,of,fatigue,,,depression,,,and,sluggishness,or,by,irritability,and,restlessness.,Because,migraine,symptoms,vary,widely,,at,least,half,of,all,migraine,sufferers,think,they,have,sinus,or,tension,headaches,,not,migraines.,
,About,20%,of,migraines,begin,with,one,or,more,neurological,symptoms,called,an,aura.,Visual,complaints,are,most,common.,They,may,include,halos,,sparkles,or,flashing,lights,,wavy,lines,,and,even,temporary,loss,of,vision.,The,aura,may,also,produce,numbness,or,tingling,on,one,side,of,the,body,,especially,the,face,or,hand.,Some,patients,develop,aura,symptoms,without,getting,headaches;,they,often,think,they,are,having,a,stroke,,not,a,migraine.,
,The,majority,of,migraines,develop,without,an,aura.,In,typical,cases,,the,pain,is,on,one,side,of,the,head,,often,beginning,around,the,eye,and,temple,before,spreading,to,the,back,of,the,head.,The,pain,is,frequently,severe,and,is,described,as,throbbing,or,pulsating.,Nausea,is,common,,and,many,migraine,patients,have,a,watering,eye,,a,running,nose,,or,congestion.,If,these,symptoms,are,prominent,,they,may,lead,to,a,misdiagnosis,of,sinus,headaches.,One,way,to,remember,the,features,of,migraine,is,to,use,the,word,POUND,
,P,is,for,pulsating,pain,
O,for,one-day,duration,of,severe,untreated,attacks,
U,for,unilateral,(one-sided),pain,
N,for,nausea,and,vomiting,
D,for,disabling,intensity.,
,Without,effective,treatment,,migraine,attacks,usually,last,for,four,to,24,hours.,When,you're,suffering,a,migraine,,even,four,hours,is,far,too,long,—,and,that's,why,early,treatment,for,a,migraine,is,so,important.,
,Migraine,treatment., If,you,spot,a,migraine,in,its,very,earliest,stages,,you,may,be,able,to,control,it,with,nonprescription,pain,relievers.,Acetaminophen,,aspirin,,ibuprofen,,naproxen,,and,a,combination,of,pain,medications,and,caffeine,are,all,effective,—,if,you,take,a,full,dose,very,early,in,the,attack.,
,When,prescription,drugs,are,needed,,most,doctors,turn,to,the,triptans,,which,are,available,as,tablets,,nasal,sprays,,or,as,injections,that,patients,can,learn,to,give,to,themselves.,Examples,include,sumatriptan,(Imitrex),,zolmitriptan,(Zomig),,and,rizatriptan,(Maxalt).,Triptans,provide,complete,relief,within,two,hours,for,up,to,70%,of,patients;,the,response,is,best,if,treatment,is,started,early.,Some,patients,require,a,second,dose,within,12,to,24,hours.,Patients,with,cardiovascular,disease,and,those,who,take,a,high,dose,of,certain,antidepressants,need,to,discuss,the,risks,of,using,them,with,their,doctor.,
,Work,with,your,doctor,to,find,the,migraine,treatment,that,works,best,for,you.,Remember,,though,,that,overuse,can,lead,to,rebound,headaches,and,a,vicious,cycle,of,drugs,and,headaches.,So,,if,you,need,treatment,more,than,two,or,three,times,a,week,,consider,preventive,medications.,
,Migraine,prevention., Some,people,can,prevent,migraines,simply,by,avoiding,triggers.,Others,do,well,with,prompt,therapy,for,occasional,attacks.,But,patients,who,suffer,frequent,migraine,attacks,often,benefit,from,preventive,medications.,Effective,prescription,drugs,include,beta,blockers,(such,as,propranolol,,nadolol,and,atenolol),,certain,antidepressants,(such,as,amitriptyline),,and,certain,antiseizure,medications,(such,topiramate,and,valproate).,Difficult,cases,may,benefit,from,referral,to,a,headache,specialist.,
,Cluster,headaches,
,Cluster,headaches,are,uncommon,but,very,severe,headaches,,and,they,occur,five,times,more,often,in,men,than,women.,Although,anyone,can,get,cluster,headaches,,the,typical,patient,is,a,middle-aged,man,with,a,history,of,smoking.,
,The,problem,gets,its,name,because,the,headaches,tend,to,come,in,clusters,,with,one,to,eight,headaches,a,day,during,a,one-,to,three-month,period,every,year,or,two,,often,at,the,same,time,of,year.,The,pain,always,strikes,one,side,of,the,head,and,is,very,severe.,The,eye,on,the,painful,side,is,red,and,watery,,the,eyelid,may,droop,,and,the,nose,runs,or,is,blocked.,The,attack,starts,abruptly,and,lasts,for,30,to,60,minutes.,Most,sufferers,become,restless,and,agitated,during,the,attack;,unable,to,sit,still,,they,pace,,jog,in,place,,or,beat,their,head,against,a,wall.,Nausea,and,sensitivity,to,light,and,sound,may,accompany,the,pain.,
,Inhaling,high,flow,oxygen,soon,after,the,onset,of,the,headache,can,often,stop,the,attack.,Sumatriptan,is,often,effective,for,cluster,headaches,,particularly,when,given,by,injection.,Other,triptans,may,also,help.,Some,patients,favor,lidocaine,nose,drops,,dihydroergotamine,injections,,or,other,treatments.,The,most,effective,medication,for,preventing,cluster,headache,attacks,is,verapamil,,a,calcium-channel,blocker.,Other,drugs,that,may,help,include,divalproex,,topiramate,,and,lithium.,
,Other,types,of,headaches,
,Doctors,have,diagnosed,hundreds,of,conditions,associated,with,headaches.,Here,are,just,a,few:,
,Medication,headaches., Many,drugs,number,headaches,among,their,side,effects.,And,although,it,seems,paradoxical,,many,medications,used,to,treat,headaches,can,also,cause,medication,overuse,headaches,or,rebound,headaches.,Migraine,sufferers,are,particularly,vulnerable,to,a,vicious,cycle,of,pain,leading,to,more,medication,,which,triggers,more,pain.,If,you,have,frequent,headaches,and,use,medication,,OTC,or,prescription,,or,both,,for,more,than,10,to,15,days,a,month,,you,may,have,medication,overuse,headaches.,The,way,to,find,out,is,to,discontinue,or,taper,your,medication,—,but,always,consult,your,doctor,first.,A,corticosteroid,such,as,prednisone,may,help,control,pain,during,the,withdrawal,period.,
,Sinus,headaches., ,Acute,sinusitis, causes,pain,over,the,forehead,,around,the,nose,and,eyes,,over,the,cheeks,,or,in,the,upper,teeth.,Stooping,forward,increases,the,pain.,Thick,nasal,discharge,,congestion,,and,fever,pinpoint,the,problem,to,the,sinuses.,When,the,acute,infection,resolves,,the,pain,disappears.,Sinusitis,is,not,a,common,cause,of,chronic,or,recurrent,headaches.,
,Ice,cream,headaches., Some,people,develop,sharp,,sudden,headache,pain,when,they,eat,anything,cold.,The,pain,is,over,in,less,than,a,minute,,even,if,you,keep,eating.,If,you,are,bothered,by,ice,cream,headaches,,try,eating,slowly,and,warming,the,cold,food,at,the,front,of,your,mouth,before,you,swallow,it.,
,Headache,from,high,blood,pressure., Except,in,cases,of,very,high,blood,pressure,,hypertension,does,not,cause,headaches.,In,fact,,most,people,with ,high,blood,pressure, don't have,any,symptoms,at,all,,and,a,study,of,51,234,people,reported,that,hypertension,was,associated,with,a ,reduced, incidence,of,headaches.,But,that's,no,reason,to,neglect,your,blood,pressure.,Hypertension,leads,to,strokes,,,heart,attacks,,,,heart,failure,,,and,kidney,disease,,so,all,men,should,have,their,pressure,checked,,and,then,take,steps,to,correct,abnormalities.,
,Headache,from,exercise,and,sex., Sudden,,strenuous,exercise,can,bring,on,a,headache.,Gradual,warm-ups,or,treatment,with,an,anti-inflammatory,medication,before,exercise,can,help.,Sexual,intercourse,may,also,trigger,headaches;,some,men,note,only,dull,pain,,but,others,suffer,from,severe,attacks,called,orgasmic,headaches.,Some,people,can,prevent,orgasmic,headaches,by,taking,an,NSAID,30,to,60,minutes,before,intercourse.,
,Headache,testing,
,Modern,medicine,depends,on,tests,to,diagnose,many,problems.,For,most,headaches,,though,,a,good,old-fashioned,history,and,physical,will,do,the,job.,In,fact,,CT,scans,,MRIs,,and,EEGs,(brain,wave,tests),look,normal,in,tension-type,headaches,,migraines,,and,cluster,headaches.,Still,,these,tests,can,be,vital,in,patients,with,warning,signs,or,other,worrisome,headaches.,
,Living,with,constant,headaches,
,For,most,of,us,,an,occasional,headache,is,nothing,more,than,a,temporary,speed,bump,in,the,course,of,a,busy,day.,Even,so,,most,men,can,ease,the,problem,with,simple,lifestyle,measures,and,nonprescription,medications.,Relaxation,techniques,,biofeedback,,yoga,,and,acupuncture,may,also,help.,But,for,some,of,us,,headaches,are,a,big,problem.,Learn,to,recognize,warning,signs,that,call,for,prompt,medical,care.,Work,with,your,doctor,to,develop,a,program,to,prevent,and,treat,migraines,and,other,serious,headaches.,And,don't,fall,into,the,trap,of,overusing,medications;,for,some,gents,,rebound,headaches,are,the,biggest,pain,of,all.,

,
,,
,What,Are,Headaches?,
,Although,it,may,feel,like,it,,a,headache,is,not,actually,a,pain,in,your,brain.,The,brain,tells,you,when,other,parts,of,your,body,hurt,,but,it,can't,feel,pain,itself.,
,Most,headaches,happen,in,the,nerves,,blood,vessels,,and,muscles,that,cover,a,person's,head,and,neck.,Sometimes,the,muscles,or,blood,vessels,swell,,tighten,,or,go,through,other,changes,that,stimulate,the,surrounding,nerves,or,put,pressure,on,them.,These,nerves,send,a,rush,of,pain,messages,to,the,brain,,and,this,brings,on,a,headache.,
,What,Are,the,Kinds,of,Headaches?,
,The,most,common,type,of,headache,is,a,,tension,headache,,(also,called,a,muscle-contraction,headache).,Tension,headaches,happen,when,stressed-out,head,or,neck,muscles,squeeze,too,hard.,This,causes,pain,often,described,as:,
,
,feeling,as,though,someone,is,pressing,or,squeezing,on,the,front,,back,,or,both,sides,of,the,head,
,dull,
,aching,
,constant,
,
,Pain,that's,especially,sharp,and,throbbing,can,be,a,sign,of,a,,migraine,headache,.,Migraine,headaches,aren't,as,common,as,tension,headaches.,But,for,teens,who,do,get,them,,the,pain,can,be,strong,enough,to,make,them,miss,school,or,other,activities,if,the,headaches,aren't,treated.,
,One,big,difference,between,tension,headaches,and,migraines,is,that,migraines,sometimes,cause,people,to,feel,sick,or,even,to,throw,up.,Tension,headaches,typically,don't,cause,nausea,or,vomiting.,
,Most,migraines,last,anywhere,from,30,minutes,to,6,hours.,Some,can,last,as,long,as,a,couple,of,days.,They,can,feel,worse,when,someone,is,doing,physical,activity,or,is,around,light,,smells,,or,loud,sounds.,
,What,Causes,Headaches?,
,Lots,of,different,things,can,bring,on,headaches.,Most,headaches,are,related,to:,
,
,infections,(such,as,ear,infections,,viruses,like,the,,flu,,or,a,,cold,,,,strep,throat,,,,meningitis,,,or,,sinus,infections,),
,stress,
,dehydration,
,computer,or,TV,watching,
,loud,music,
,smoking,
,alcohol,
,caffeine,,(people,who,drink,a,lot,of,caffeinated,drinks,might,get,caffeine-withdrawal,headaches),
,skipping,meals,
,lack,of,sleep, or,sudden,changes,in,sleep,patterns,
,having,a,head,injury,
,taking,a,long,trip,in,a,car,or,bus,
,allergies,
,some,medicines,(headaches,can,be,a,side,effect),
,vision,problems,
,smelling,strong,odors,such,as,perfume,,smoke,,fumes,,or,a,new,car,or,carpet,
,some,foods,(such,as,alcohol,,cheese,,nuts,,pizza,,chocolate,,ice,cream,,fatty,or,fried,food,,lunchmeats,and,hot,dogs,,yogurt,,aspartame,,and,MSG),
,
,For,some,teens,,hormonal,changes,can,also,cause,headaches.,For,example,,some,girls,get,headaches,just,before,their,,periods,,or,at,other,regular,times,during,their,monthly,cycle.,
,Who,Gets,Headaches?,
,Headaches,are,common,in,people,of,all,ages.,
,Migraine,headaches,often,run,in,the,family.,So,if,a,parent,,grandparent,,or,other,family,member,gets,them,,there's,a,chance,you,could,get,them,too.,Some,people,are,sensitive,to,things,that,can,bring,on,migraine,headaches,(called,triggers),,such,as,some,foods,,stress,,changes,in,sleep,patterns,,or,even,the,weather.,
,When,Should,I,Call,the,Doctor?,
,If,you,think,your,headaches,may,be,migraines,,you'll,want,to,see,a,doctor,to,treat,them,and,learn,ways,to,try,to,avoid,getting,the,headaches,in,the,first,place.,Sometimes,relaxation,exercises,or,changes,in,diet,or,sleeping,habits,are,all,that's,needed.,But,if,needed,,a,doctor,also,can,prescribe,medicine,to,help,control,the,headaches.,
,You'll,also,want,to,see,a,doctor,if,you,have,any,of,these,symptoms,as,well,as,a,headache:,
,
,changes,in,vision,,such,as,blurriness,or,seeing,spots,
,tingling,sensations,(for,example,,in,the,arms,or,legs),
,skin,rash,
,weakness,,dizziness,,or,difficulty,walking,or,standing,
,neck,pain,or,stiffness,
,fever,
,
,If,you,do,see,a,doctor,for,headaches,,he,or,she,will,probably,want,to,do,an,exam,and,get,your,,,
,
,,medical,history,to,help,figure,out,what,might,be,causing,them.,
,The,doctor,may,ask,you:,
,
,how,severe,and,frequent,your,headaches,are,
,when,they,happen,(to,see,if,the,headaches,have,a,pattern,or,are,connected,to,any,specific,foods,or,events),
,about,any,medicine,you,take,
,about,any,allergies,you,have,
,if,you're,feeling,,stressed,
,about,your,diet,,habits,,sleeping,patterns,,and,what,seems,to,help,or,worsen,the,headaches,
,
,The,doctor,may,also,do,blood,tests,or,imaging,tests,,such,as,a,,CAT,scan,,or,MRI,of,the,brain,,to,rule,out,medical,problems.,
,Sometimes,doctors,will,refer,people,with,headaches,they,think,might,be,migraines,or,a,symptom,of,a,more,serious,problem,to,a,specialist,like,a,,,
,
,,,neurologist,,,a,doctor,who,specializes,in,the,brain,and,nervous,system.,
,It's,very,rare,that,headaches,are,a,sign,of,something,serious.,But,see,a,doctor,if,you,get,headaches,a,lot,or,have,a,headache,that:,
,
,is,particularly,painful,and,different,from,the,kinds,of,headaches,you've,had,before,
,doesn't,go,away,easily,
,follows,an,injury,,such,as,,hitting,your,head,
,causes,you,to,miss,school,
,happens,along,with,any,of,these,symptoms:,
,,,
,changes,in,vision,,such,as,blurriness,or,seeing,spots,
,tingling,sensations,(such,as,in,the,arms,or,legs),
,skin,rash,
,weakness,,dizziness,,or,trouble,walking,or,standing,
,neck,pain,or,stiffness,
,fever,
,,,
,
,How,Can,I,Feel,Better?,
,Most,headaches,will,go,away,if,a,person,rests,or,sleeps.,When,you,get,a,headache,,lie,down,in,a,cool,,dark,,quiet,room,and,close,your,eyes.,It,may,help,to,put,a,cool,,moist,cloth,across,your,forehead,or,eyes.,Relax.,Breathe,easily,and,deeply.,
,If,a,headache,doesn't,go,away,or,it's,really,bad,,you,may,want,to,take,an,over-the-counter,pain,reliever,like,acetaminophen,or,ibuprofen.,You,can,buy,these,in,drugstores,under,various,brand,names,,and,your,drugstore,may,carry,its,own,generic,brand.,It's,a,good,idea,to,avoid,taking,aspirin,for,a,headache,because,it,may,cause,a,rare,but,dangerous,disease,called,Reye,syndrome.,
,If,you,are,taking,over-the-counter,pain,medicines,more,than,twice,a,week,for,headaches,,or,if,you,find,these,medicines,are,not,working,for,you,,talk,to,your,doctor.,
,Most,headaches,are,not,a,sign,that,something,more,is,wrong.,But,if,your,headaches,are,intense,and,happen,often,,there,are,lots,of,things,a,doctor,can,do,,from,recommending,changes,in,your,diet,to,prescribing,medicine.,You,don't,have,to,put,up,with,the,pain!,
