You can experience up to four phases during a migraine episode, each of which can be recognized by its own set of characteristics.
Your migraine attacks may not all be exactly the same, but recognizing the range of symptoms that can occur can help tip you off as to if what you're experiencing could be a migraine.
If you're already diagnosed, knowing where these symptoms fit into the typical sequence of stages can help you decide when to take your medication.
Migraines may result in medication-related complications, and rarely, a migraine can induce a serious health complication.
Other conditions, such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) can produce symptoms similar to those of a migraine, so you may need to seek medical attention if you have any warning signs.

Frequent Symptoms    Migraine episodes can include several stages: prodome, aura, headache, and postdrome.
You may cycle through all of these phases when you have a migraine, or you might experience just one, two, or three of them.
The headache phase is the most common, while the aura is the least common.
Prodrome    The prodrome is characterized by premonitory symptoms of an impending migraine and it can begin hours or days before a migraine episode reaches its peak intensity.
Most people with migraine experience prodromal symptoms, and taking migraine medication during this stage may stop the episode from progressing.
Typical symptoms during a prodrome are:1﻿          Food cravings Constipation or diarrhea Mood changes: sadness, irritability, anxiety Muscle stiffness or soreness, especially in the neck Fatigue Excessive yawning Nausea Fluid retention, bloating Increased frequency of urination Difficulty concentrating Vivid dreams Sensitivity to light, sounds, or smells Feeling cold           Aura    Approximately one-third of migraineurs experience aura, which usually follows the prodrome and lasts for less than an hour.2﻿ This stage is characterized by neurological symptoms, and it can be quite terrifying, especially when you experience it for the first time.
Symptoms of a migraine aura can include:    Visual changes: flashing lights, wavy lines, spots, partial loss of vision, blind spot, blurry vision Tingling, numbness, or hypersensitivity of the face or extremities Vertigo (a sense that the room is spinning) Difficulty finding words and/or speaking Confusion Partial paralysis Olfactory hallucinations (smelling odors that aren't there) Auditory hallucinations (hearing things that are not there) A decrease or loss of hearing          An Overview of Migraine With Aura     Headache    The head pain of a migraine is often described as throbbing, pounding, or pulsating.
You may also experience other symptoms along with the head pain.
This phase usually lasts from four to 72 hours.1﻿    Common characteristics of the headache phase may include:    Hemicranial (on one side of the head) pain that can shift to the other side or become bilateral Phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) Photophobia (sensitivity to light) Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea or constipation Nasal congestion and/or runny nose Sadness or anxiety Hot flashes and chills Dizziness Dehydration or fluid retention     Migraine effects are not limited to the head and often affect the neck, shoulders, arms, or the entire body.
The symptoms are often worsened by activities such as walking, riding in a car, or exercising.
Postdrome    After the most intense phase of a migraine, you may experience a postdrome before your migraine attack is completely over.
The symptoms of postdrome include:1﻿    FatigueMood changes, which can include sadness, anxiety, or elevated moodMuscle achesDizziness or lightheadednessDifficulty concentratingStiff neckScalp tenderness    Many people describe postdrome as feeling "like a zombie" or hungover.
Postdromal symptoms can be associated with abnormal cerebral blood flow and electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns for up to 24 hours after the end of the headache stage.3﻿ Even if you do not experience the headache stage, you may still experience a postdrome phase.
Concurrent Phases  Migraine stages may overlap, sometimes with the aura occurring at the same time as the prodrome, headache, or postdrome.
Prodromal symptoms may linger even as the headache peaks, and postdromal symptoms can begin before the headache starts to resolve.
Childhood Migraines    Children also experience migraines, and the symptoms can differ from those of adults.
If you note the following symptoms in your child, migraines may be the cause, especially if your child has a family history of the condition:4    StomachacheNauseaDizzinessMotion sicknessMoodinessExcessive sleepiness    Be sure to discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider.
They could be signs of another medical condition, but if migraines are the cause, your child can take medication to help prevent and treat episodes.
When Children Have Migraines      Rare Symptoms    Rare symptoms are typically associated with migraine subtypes, and while they may be similar to a migraine aura, the main difference is that these unusual symptoms are usually the most prominent aspect of the migraine episodes.
Weakness    Weakness, typically in one arm, occurs with hemiplegic migraine.5﻿ If you have hemiplegic migraines, you may also experience several migraine stages and other aura symptoms.
There is a strong hereditary tendency to develop this type of migraine.
Stomachaches    More common in children than adults, abdominal migraine is characterized by stomachaches that occur without a gastrointestinal cause and may involve nausea and vomiting.
Paralysis of Eye Movement    Double vision, blurred vision, a droopy eyelid, or an obvious inability to move one eye can be a sign of ophthalmoplegic migraine.
Absent Headache    Although not very common, you can have a migraine aura without a headache.
There are several terms used to describe this experience, including "silent migraine," "sans-migraine," and "migraine equivalent."
When There's No Headache, Is It Still a Migraine?
Complications/ Sub-Group Indications    Migraines do not typically cause complications, although they can.
The most common complications are related to medication use.
Medication Effects    Side effects of overuse can include stomach pain and gastrointestinal bleeding from taking high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs).
Other medications, including triptans and ergot medications, can cause side effects such as dizziness, tingling, or even vascular complications when taken at higher doses than directed.
Keep in mind that all medications—whether over-the-counter or prescription— can cause side effects even at recommended doses.
Medication rebound headaches or medication withdrawal headaches can occur when you take migraine medications at high doses or for a prolonged time and then abruptly stop.
Be sure to discuss a medication plan with your healthcare provider—and if it isn't working, then discuss another plan instead of taking extra medication to deal with your migraines.
Medications That Cause Overuse Headaches     Migraine Complications    Complications from a migraine itself include some serious concerns that require medical attention:    Status migrainosus: If your migraine lasts longer than 72 hours despite treatment, it's termed status migrainosus, a condition that is unlikely to resolve with your regular prescription.
You should seek medical attention because you may need treatment with intravenous (IV) medication.6﻿    Migrainous infarction: An infarction in the brain is a type of stroke caused by lack of blood flow.
A migrainous infarction begins with migraine symptoms that can eventually involve stroke symptoms and may produce permanent neurological effects.
Seizure: A convulsive episode that may be characterized by involuntary shaking or jerking may occur as a result of a migraine.
The physiological reason for this complication is not well understood.
Migraine Complications      When to See a Healthcare Provider/Go to the Hospital    Migraines do not normally require emergency medical attention.
The treatment is really based on a plan for both prevention and treatment of acute attacks.
Nevertheless, when you are not sure if your symptoms are caused by a migraine, or when your migraine pattern changes, you need to seek medical attention.
Urgent Medical Care    Symptoms such as paralysis, loss of sensation, difficulty communicating, loss of vision, and double vision can all be manifestations of a stroke, MS, meningitis, seizures, and other neurological illnesses.7﻿ If you experience any of these rare symptoms and they have not been attributed to migraines (or if you're unsure of their connection), then you should get prompt medical attention.
Even if you have a diagnosis of migraines, you should have a medical evaluation if your headaches occur with certain features, including:    The worst headache of your lifeFeversRecurrent vomiting/can't keep anything downHead traumaFalling/ inability to balance     Talk to Your Healthcare Provider    If your migraine pattern changes in frequency or intensity or if your symptoms change, you should talk to your healthcare provider.
You may need a diagnostic evaluation or a change in your treatment plan.

It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound.
Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so severe that it interferes with your daily activities.
For some people, a warning symptom known as an aura occurs before or with the headache.
An aura can include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking.
Medications can help prevent some migraines and make them less painful.

Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages.
ProdromeOne or two days before a migraine, you might notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including:      Constipation     Mood changes, from depression to euphoria     Food cravings     Neck stiffness     Increased urination     Fluid retention     Frequent yawning                                    AuraFor some people, an aura might occur before or during migraines.
Auras are reversible symptoms of the nervous system.
They're usually visual but can also include other disturbances.
Each symptom usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and can last up to 60 minutes.
Examples of migraine auras include:      Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light     Vision loss     Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg     Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body     Difficulty speaking                                    AttackA migraine usually lasts from 4 to 72 hours if untreated.
How often migraines occur varies from person to person.
Migraines might occur rarely or strike several times a month.
During a migraine, you might have:      Pain usually on one side of your head, but often on both sides     Pain that throbs or pulses     Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch     Nausea and vomiting                                    Post-dromeAfter a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused and washed out for up to a day.
Some people report feeling elated.
Sudden head movement might bring on the pain again briefly.
When to see a doctorMigraines are often undiagnosed and untreated.
If you regularly have signs and symptoms of migraine, keep a record of your attacks and how you treated them.
Then make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your headaches.
Even if you have a history of headaches, see your doctor if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different.
See your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room if you have any of the following signs and symptoms, which could indicate a more serious medical problem:      An abrupt, severe headache like a thunderclap     Headache with fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizures, double vision, numbness or weakness in any part of the body, which could be a sign of a stroke     Headache after a head injury     A chronic headache that is worse after coughing, exertion, straining or a sudden movement     New headache pain after age 50 More InformationMigraine care at Mayo ClinicMigraines and gastrointestinal problems: Is there a link?
Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic                                                      CausesThough migraine causes aren't fully understood, genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role.
Changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway, might be involved.
So might imbalances in brain chemicals — including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system.
Researchers are studying the role of serotonin in migraines.
Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).
Migraine triggersThere are a number of migraine triggers, including:           Hormonal changes in women.
Fluctuations in estrogen, such as before or during menstrual periods, pregnancy and menopause, seem to trigger headaches in many women.
Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives, also can worsen migraines.
Some women, however, find that their migraines occur less often when taking these medications.
Drinks.
These include alcohol, especially wine, and too much caffeine, such as coffee.
Stress.
Stress at work or home can cause migraines.
Sensory stimuli.
Bright or flashing lights can induce migraines, as can loud sounds.
Strong smells — such as perfume, paint thinner, secondhand smoke and others — trigger migraines in some people.
Sleep changes.
Missing sleep or getting too much sleep can trigger migraines in some people.
Physical factors.
Intense physical exertion, including sexual activity, might provoke migraines.
Weather changes.
A change of weather or barometric pressure can prompt a migraine.
Medications.
Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines.
Foods.
Aged cheeses and salty and processed foods might trigger migraines.
So might skipping meals.
Food additives.
These include the sweetener aspartame and the preservative monosodium glutamate (MSG), found in many foods.
More InformationMigraine care at Mayo ClinicMigraines: Are they triggered by weather changes?Mayo Clinic Minute Weathering migraines                                   Risk factorsSeveral factors make you more prone to having migraines, including:      Family history.
If you have a family member with migraines, then you have a good chance of developing them too.
Age.
Migraines can begin at any age, though the first often occurs during adolescence.
Migraines tend to peak during your 30s, and gradually become less severe and less frequent in the following decades.
Sex.
Women are three times more likely than men to have migraines.
Hormonal changes.
For women who have migraines, headaches might begin just before or shortly after onset of menstruation.
They might also change during pregnancy or menopause.
Migraines generally improve after menopause.
ComplicationsTaking painkillers too often can trigger serious medication-overuse headaches.
The risk seems to be highest with aspirin, acetaminophen and caffeine combinations.
Overuse headaches may also occur if you take aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) for more than 14 days a month or triptans, sumatriptan (Imitrex, Tosymra) or rizatriptan (Maxalt, Maxalt-MLT) for more than nine days a month.
Medication-overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches.
You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle.

[1] Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days.
[1] Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell.
[2] The pain is generally made worse by physical activity,[14] although regular exercise may have prophylactic effects.
[15] Up to one-third of people affected have aura: typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur.
[14] Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following, but not everyone has this symptom.
[16] Migraine is believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors.
[3] About two-thirds of cases run in families.
[5] Changing hormone levels may also play a role, as migraine affects slightly more boys than girls before puberty and two to three times more women than men.
[4][17] The risk of migraine usually decreases during pregnancy and after menopause.
[4][18] The underlying mechanisms are not fully known.
[18] They are, however, believed to involve the nerves and blood vessels of the brain.
[5] Initial recommended treatment is with simple pain medication such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) for the headache, medication for the nausea, and the avoidance of triggers.
[10] Specific medications such as triptans or ergotamines may be used in those for whom simple pain medications are not effective.
[5] Caffeine in combination with other analgesics is safe and effective in treatment of acute migraine.
[19][20][21] A number of medications are useful to prevent attacks including metoprolol, valproate, and topiramate.
[8][9] Globally, approximately 15% of people are affected by migraine.
[11] In the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2010, it was ranked as the third most prevalent disorder in the world.
[22] It most often starts at puberty and is worst during middle age.
[1] As of 2016, it is one of the most common causes of disability.
[23] An early description consistent with migraines is contained in the Ebers papyrus, written around 1500 BC in ancient Egypt.
[24] The word migraine is from the Greek ἡμικρᾱνίᾱ (hēmikrāníā), 'pain in half of the head',[25] from ἡμι- (hēmi-), 'half', and κρᾱνίον (krāníon), 'skull'.

[5][27] About 15–30% of people living with migraine experience episodes with aura,[10][28] and they also frequently experience episodes without aura.
[29] The severity of the pain, duration of the headache, and frequency of attacks are variable.
[5] A migraine lasting longer than 72 hours is termed status migrainosus.
[30] There are four possible phases to a migraine, although not all the phases are necessarily experienced:[14]  The prodrome, which occurs hours or days before the headache The aura, which immediately precedes the headache The pain phase, also known as headache phase The postdrome, the effects experienced following the end of a migraine attack Migraine is associated with major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive–compulsive disorder.
These psychiatric disorders are approximately 2–5 times more common in people without aura, and 3–10 times more common in people with aura.
[31]  Prodrome phase[edit] Prodromal or premonitory symptoms occur in about 60% of those with migraines,[2][32] with an onset that can range from two hours to two days before the start of pain or the aura.
[33] These symptoms may include a wide variety of phenomena,[34] including altered mood, irritability, depression or euphoria, fatigue, craving for certain food(s), stiff muscles (especially in the neck), constipation or diarrhea, and sensitivity to smells or noise.
[32] This may occur in those with either migraine with aura or migraine without aura.
[35] Neuroimaging indicates the limbic system and hypothalamus as the origin of prodromal symptoms in migraine.
[36]  Aura phase[edit]           Aura is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache.
[2] Aura appears gradually over a number of minutes (usually occurring over 5–60 minutes) and generally lasts less than 60 minutes.
[37][38] Symptoms can be visual, sensory or motoric in nature, and many people experience more than one.
[39] Visual effects occur most frequently: they occur in up to 99% of cases and in more than 50% of cases are not accompanied by sensory or motor effects.
[39] Visual disturbances often consist of a scintillating scotoma (an area of partial alteration in the field of vision which flickers and may interfere with a person's ability to read or drive).
[2] These typically start near the center of vision and then spread out to the sides with zigzagging lines which have been described as looking like fortifications or walls of a castle.
[39] Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines.
[39] Some people lose part of their field of vision known as hemianopsia while others experience blurring.
[39] Sensory aura are the second most common type; they occur in 30–40% of people with auras.
[39] Often a feeling of pins-and-needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose–mouth area on the same side.
[39] Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has passed with a loss of position sense.
[39] Other symptoms of the aura phase can include speech or language disturbances, world spinning, and less commonly motor problems.
[39] Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic migraine, and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras.
[39] Auditory hallucinations or delusions have also been described.
[40]  Pain phase[edit] Classically the headache is unilateral, throbbing, and moderate to severe in intensity.
[37] It usually comes on gradually[37] and is aggravated by physical activity.
[14] However, the effects of physical activity on migraine are complex and some researchers have concluded that, while exercise can trigger migraine attacks, regular exercise may have a prophylactic effect and decrease frequency of attacks.
[15] The feeling of pulsating pain is not in phase with the pulse.
[41] In more than 40% of cases, however, the pain may be bilateral and neck pain is commonly associated with it.
[42] Bilateral pain is particularly common in those who have migraine without aura.
[2] Less commonly pain may occur primarily in the back or top of the head.
[2] The pain usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults,[37] however in young children frequently lasts less than 1 hour.
[43] The frequency of attacks is variable, from a few in a lifetime to several a week, with the average being about one a month.
[44][45] The pain is frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, sensitivity to smells, fatigue and irritability.
[2] Many thus seek a dark and quiet room.
[46] In a basilar migraine, a migraine with neurological symptoms related to the brain stem or with neurological symptoms on both sides of the body,[47] common effects include a sense of the world spinning, light-headedness, and confusion.
[2] Nausea occurs in almost 90% of people, and vomiting occurs in about one-third.
[46] Other symptoms may include blurred vision, nasal stuffiness, diarrhea, frequent urination, pallor, or sweating.
[48] Swelling or tenderness of the scalp may occur as can neck stiffness.
[48] Associated symptoms are less common in the elderly.
[49]  Silent migraine[edit] Sometimes, aura occurs without a subsequent headache.
[39] This is known in modern classification as a typical aura without headache, or acephalgic migraine in previous classification, or commonly as a silent migraine.
[50][51] However, silent migraine can still produce debilitating symptoms, with visual disturbance, vision loss in half of both eyes, alterations in color perception, and other sensory problems, like sensitivity to light, sound, and odors, and aura sudden outbreak without headache can be scary.
[52] It can last from 15 to 30 minutes, usually no longer than 60 minutes, and it can recur or appear as an isolated event.
[51]  Postdrome[edit] The migraine postdrome could be defined as that constellation of symptoms occurring once the acute headache has settled.
[53] Many report a sore feeling in the area where the migraine was, and some report impaired thinking for a few days after the headache has passed.
The person may feel tired or "hung over" and have head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes, and weakness.
[54] According to one summary, "Some people feel unusually refreshed or euphoric after an attack, whereas others note depression and malaise.
"[55] For some individuals this can vary each time.
Cause[edit] The underlying causes of migraines are unknown.
[56] However, they are believed to be related to a mix of environmental and genetic factors.
[3] They run in families in about two-thirds of cases[5] and rarely occur due to a single gene defect.
[57] While migraines were once believed to be more common in those of high intelligence, this does not appear to be true.
[58] A number of psychological conditions are associated, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder,[59] as are many biological events or triggers.
Genetics[edit] Main article: Genetics of migraine headaches Studies of twins indicate a 34% to 51% genetic influence of likelihood to develop migraine.
[3] This genetic relationship is stronger for migraine with aura than for migraines without aura.
[29] A number of specific variants of genes increase the risk by a small to moderate amount.
[57] Single gene disorders that result in migraines are rare.
[57] One of these is known as familial hemiplegic migraine, a type of migraine with aura, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
[60][61] Four genes have been shown to be involved in familial hemiplegic migraine.
[62] Three of these genes are involved in ion transport.
[62] The fourth is an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex.
[62] Another genetic disorder associated with migraine is CADASIL syndrome or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
[2] One meta-analysis found a protective effect from an angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphisms on migraine.
[63] The TRPM8 gene, which codes for a cation channel, has been linked to migraines.
[64]  Triggers[edit] Migraine may be induced by triggers, with some reporting it as an influence in a minority of cases[5] and others the majority.
[65] Many things such as fatigue, certain foods, and weather have been labeled as triggers; however, the strength and significance of these relationships are uncertain.
[65][66] Most people with migraines report experiencing triggers.
[67] Symptoms may start up to 24 hours after a trigger.
[5]  Physiological aspects[edit] Common triggers quoted are stress, hunger, and fatigue (these equally contribute to tension headaches).
[65] Psychological stress has been reported as a factor by 50 to 80% of people.
[68] Migraine has also been associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and abuse.
[69] Migraine episodes are more likely to occur around menstruation.
[68] Other hormonal influences, such as menarche, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause, also play a role.
[70] These hormonal influences seem to play a greater role in migraine without aura.
[58] Migraine episodes typically do not occur during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, or following menopause.
[2]  Dietary aspects[edit] Between 12 and 60% of people report foods as triggers.
[71][72] Evidence for such triggers, however, mostly relies on self-reports and is not rigorous enough to prove or disprove any particular trigger.
[73] A clear explanation for why food might trigger migraines is also lacking.
[71] There does not appear to be evidence for an effect of tyramine – which is naturally present in chocolate, alcoholic beverages, most cheeses and processed meats – on migraine.
[74] Likewise, while monosodium glutamate (MSG) is frequently reported,[75] evidence does not consistently support that it is a dietary trigger.
[76]  Environmental aspects[edit] A review on potential triggers in the indoor and outdoor environment concluded that there is insufficient evidence to confirm environmental factors as causing migraine.
They nevertheless suggested that people living with migraine take some preventive measures related to indoor air quality and lighting.
This includes ventilation and various black out items to reduce light at the maximum rate.
[77]  Pathophysiology[edit]   Animation of cortical spreading depression Migraine is believed to be primarily a neurological disorder,[78][79][80] while others believe it to be a neurovascular disorder with blood vessels playing the key role, although current evidence does not support this completely.
[81][82][83][84] Others believe both are likely important.
[85][86][87][88] One theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem.
[89]  Aura[edit] Cortical spreading depression, or spreading depression according to Leão, is a burst of neuronal activity followed by a period of inactivity, which is seen in those with migraines with aura.
[90] There are a number of explanations for its occurrence, including activation of NMDA receptors leading to calcium entering the cell.
[90] After the burst of activity, the blood flow to the cerebral cortex in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours.
[90] It is believed that when depolarization travels down the underside of the brain, nerves that sense pain in the head and neck are triggered.
[90]  Pain[edit] The exact mechanism of the head pain which occurs during a migraine episode is unknown.
[91] Some evidence supports a primary role for central nervous system structures (such as the brainstem and diencephalon),[92] while other data support the role of peripheral activation (such as via the sensory nerves that surround blood vessels of the head and neck).
[91] The potential candidate vessels include dural arteries, pial arteries and extracranial arteries such as those of the scalp.
[91] The role of vasodilatation of the extracranial arteries, in particular, is believed to be significant.
[93]  Neuromodulators[edit] Adenosine, a neuromodulator, may be involved.
[94] Released after the progressive cleavage of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine acts on adenosine receptors to put the body and brain in a low activity state by dilating blood vessels and slowing the heart rate, such as before and during the early stages of sleep.
Adenosine levels have been found to be high during migraine attacks.
[94][95] Caffeine's role as an inhibitor of adenosine may explain its effect in reducing migraine.
[96] Low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), are also believed to be involved.
[97] Calcitonin gene related peptides (CGRPs) have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine, as levels of it become elevated during an attack.
[10][41]  Diagnosis[edit] The diagnosis of a migraine is based on signs and symptoms.
[5] Neuroimaging tests are not necessary to diagnose migraine, but may be used to find other causes of headaches in those whose examination and history do not confirm a migraine diagnosis.
[98] It is believed that a substantial number of people with the condition remain undiagnosed.
[5] The diagnosis of migraine without aura, according to the International Headache Society, can be made according to the following criteria, the "5, 4, 3, 2, 1 criteria":[14]  Five or more attacks—for migraine with aura, two attacks are sufficient for diagnosis.
Four hours to three days in duration Two or more of the following: Unilateral (affecting one side of the head) Pulsating Moderate or severe pain intensity Worsened by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity One or more of the following: Nausea and/or vomiting; Sensitivity to both light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia) If someone experiences two of the following: photophobia, nausea, or inability to work or study for a day, the diagnosis is more likely.
[99] In those with four out of five of the following: pulsating headache, duration of 4–72 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person's life, the probability that this is a migraine is 92%.
[10] In those with fewer than three of these symptoms the probability is 17%.
[10]  Classification[edit] Main article: ICHD classification and diagnosis of migraine Migraine was first comprehensively classified in 1988.
[29] The International Headache Society updated their classification of headaches in 2004.
[14] A third version was published in 2018.
[100] According to this classification, migraine is a primary headache disorder along with tension-type headaches and cluster headaches, among others.
[101] Migraine is divided into seven subclasses (some of which include further subdivisions):  Migraine without aura, or "common migraine", involves migraine headaches that are not accompanied by aura.
Migraine with aura, or "classic migraine", usually involves migraine headaches accompanied by aura.
Less commonly, aura can occur without a headache, or with a nonmigraine headache.
Two other varieties are familial hemiplegic migraine and sporadic hemiplegic migraine, in which a person has migraine with aura and with accompanying motor weakness.
If a close relative has had the same condition, it is called "familial", otherwise it is called "sporadic".
Another variety is basilar-type migraine, where a headache and aura are accompanied by difficulty speaking, world spinning, ringing in ears, or a number of other brainstem-related symptoms, but not motor weakness.
This type was initially believed to be due to spasms of the basilar artery, the artery that supplies the brainstem.
Now that this mechanism is not believed to be primary, the symptomatic term migraine with brainstem aura (MBA) is preferred.
[47] Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine include cyclical vomiting (occasional intense periods of vomiting), abdominal migraine (abdominal pain, usually accompanied by nausea), and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (occasional attacks of vertigo).
Retinal migraine involves migraine headaches accompanied by visual disturbances or even temporary blindness in one eye.
Complications of migraine describe migraine headaches and/or auras that are unusually long or unusually frequent, or associated with a seizure or brain lesion.
Probable migraine describes conditions that have some characteristics of migraines, but where there is not enough evidence to diagnose it as a migraine with certainty (in the presence of concurrent medication overuse).
Chronic migraine is a complication of migraines, and is a headache that fulfills diagnostic criteria for migraine headache and occurs for a greater time interval.
Specifically, greater or equal to 15 days/month for longer than 3 months.
[102] Abdominal migraine[edit] The diagnosis of abdominal migraine is controversial.
[103] Some evidence indicates that recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the absence of a headache may be a type of migraine[103][104] or are at least a precursor to migraines.
[29] These episodes of pain may or may not follow a migraine-like prodrome and typically last minutes to hours.
[103] They often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical migraine.
[103] Other syndromes that are believed to be precursors include cyclical vomiting syndrome and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood.
[29]  Differential diagnosis[edit] Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to a migraine headache include temporal arteritis, cluster headaches, acute glaucoma, meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
[10] Temporal arteritis typically occurs in people over 50 years old and presents with tenderness over the temple, cluster headache presents with one-sided nose stuffiness, tears and severe pain around the orbits, acute glaucoma is associated with vision problems, meningitis with fevers, and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a very fast onset.
[10] Tension headaches typically occur on both sides, are not pounding, and are less disabling.
[10] Those with stable headaches that meet criteria for migraines should not receive neuroimaging to look for other intracranial disease.
[105][106][107] This requires that other concerning findings such as papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) are not present.
People with migraines are not at an increased risk of having another cause for severe headaches.
Prevention[edit] Main article: Prevention of migraines Preventive treatments of migraine include medications, nutritional supplements, lifestyle alterations, and surgery.
Prevention is recommended in those who have headaches more than two days a week, cannot tolerate the medications used to treat acute attacks, or those with severe attacks that are not easily controlled.
[10] Recommended lifestyle changes include stopping tobacco use and reducing behaviors that interfere with sleep.
[108] The goal is to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and duration of migraine episodes, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy.
[109] Another reason for prevention is to avoid medication overuse headache.
This is a common problem and can result in chronic daily headache.
[110][111]  Medication[edit] Preventive migraine medications are considered effective if they reduce the frequency or severity of the migraine attacks by at least 50%.
[112] Due to few medications being approved specifically for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches; many medications such as beta-blockers, anticonvulsive agents such as topiramate or sodium valproate, antidepressants such as amitriptyline and calcium channel blockers such as flunarizine are used off label for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches.
[38] Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating the anticonvulsants topiramate and divalproex/sodium valproate, and the beta blockers propranolol and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence for first-line use for migraine prophylaxis in adults.
[113][114] Propranolol and topiramate have the best evidence in children; however, evidence only supports short-term benefit as of 2020.
[108][115] The beta blocker Timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity.
[113] While beta blockers are often used for first-line treatment, other antihypertensives also have a proven efficiency in migraine prevention, namely the calcium channel blocker Verapamil[116] and the angiotensin receptor blocker Candesartan.
[117][118] Tentative evidence also supports the use of magnesium supplementation.
[119] Increasing dietary intake may be better.
[120] Recommendations regarding effectiveness varied for the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin.
Frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine.
[113] The antidepressants Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are probably also effective.
[121] Angiotensin inhibition by either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist may reduce attacks.
[122] Medications in the anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide, including eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, appear to decrease the frequency of migraines by one to two per month.
[123] They are, however, expensive: a year of erenumab costs $6,900 as of 2019.
[124]  Alternative therapies[edit] Acupuncture has a small effect in reducing migraine frequency, compared to sham acupuncture, a practice where needles are placed randomly or do not penetrate the skin.
[125] Physiotherapy, massage and relaxation, and chiropractic manipulation might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches; however, the research had some problems with methodology.
[126][127] Another review, however, found evidence to support spinal manipulation to be poor and insufficient to support its use.
[128] Tentative evidence supports the use of stress reduction techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques.
[68] Regular physical exercise may decrease the frequency.
[15] Numerous psychological approaches have been developed that are aimed at preventing or reducing the frequency of migraine in adults including educational approaches, relaxation techniques, assistance in developing coping strategies, strategies to change the way one thinks of a migraine, and strategies to reduce the symptoms of a migraine.
[129] The medical evidence supporting the effectiveness of these types of psychological approaches is very limited.
[129] Among alternative medicines, butterbur has the best evidence for its use.
[130][131] However, unprocessed butterbur contains chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) which can cause liver damage, however there are versions that are PA free.
[132] In addition, butterbur may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to plants such as ragweed.
[133] There is tentative evidence that coenzyme Q10 reduces migraine frequency.
[134] Feverfew has traditionally been used as a treatment for fever, headache and migraine, women’s conditions such as difficulties in labour and regulation of menstruation, relief of stomach ache, toothache and insect bites.
During the last decades, it has mainly been used for headache and as a preventive treatment for migraine.
[135] The plant parts used for medicinal use are the dried leaves or the dried aerial parts.
Several historical data supports feverfew’s traditional medicinal uses.
[136] In addition, several clinical studies have been performed assessing the efficacy and safety of feverfew monotherapy in the prevention of migraine.
[137] The majority of the clinical trials favoured feverfew over placebo.
The data also suggest that feverfew is associated with only mild and transient adverse effects.
The frequency of migraine was positively affected after treatment with feverfew.
Reduction of migraine severity was also reported after intake of feverfew and incidence of nausea and vomiting decreased significantly.
No effect of feverfew was reported in one study.
[137] There is tentative evidence for melatonin as an add-on therapy for prevention and treatment of migraine.
[138][139] The data on melatonin are mixed and certain studies have had negative results.
[138] The reasons for the mixed findings are unclear but may stem from differences in study design and dosage.
[138] Melatonin's possible mechanisms of action in migraine are not completely clear, but may include improved sleep, direct action on melatonin receptors in the brain, and anti-inflammatory properties.
[138][140]  Devices and surgery[edit] Medical devices, such as biofeedback and neurostimulators, have some advantages in migraine prevention, mainly when common anti-migraine medications are contraindicated or in case of medication overuse.
Biofeedback helps people be conscious of some physiological parameters so as to control them and try to relax and may be efficient for migraine treatment.
[141][142] Neurostimulation uses noninvasive or implantable neurostimulators similar to pacemakers for the treatment of intractable chronic migraine with encouraging results for severe cases.
[143][144] A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator and a transcranial magnetic stimulator are approved in the United States for the prevention of migraines.
[145][146] There is also tentative evidence for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation decreases the frequency of migraines.
[147] Migraine surgery, which involves decompression of certain nerves around the head and neck, may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medications.
[148]  Management[edit] Main article: Migraine treatment There are three main aspects of treatment: trigger avoidance, acute symptomatic control, and medication for prevention.
[5] Medications are more effective if used earlier in an attack.
[5] The frequent use of medications may result in medication overuse headache, in which the headaches become more severe and more frequent.
[14] This may occur with triptans, ergotamines, and analgesics, especially opioid analgesics.
[14] Due to these concerns simple analgesics are recommended to be used less than three days per week at most.
[149]  Analgesics[edit] Recommended initial treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms are simple analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the combination of paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), aspirin, and caffeine.
[10] Several NSAIDs, including diclofenac and ibuprofen have evidence to support their use.
[150][151] Aspirin can relieve moderate to severe migraine pain, with an effectiveness similar to sumatriptan.
[152] Ketorolac is available in intravenous and intramuscular formulations.
[10] Paracetamol, either alone or in combination with metoclopramide, is another effective treatment with a low risk of adverse effects.
[153] Intravenous metoclopramide is also effective by itself.
[154][155] In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester.
[10] Naproxen by itself may not be effective as a stand-alone medicine to stop a migraine headache as it is only weakly better than a placebo medication in clinical trials.
[156]  Antiemetics[edit] Triptans[edit] Triptans such as sumatriptan are medications used to stop an active migraine headache (an abortive medication).
Triptans are the initially recommended treatments for those with moderate to severe pain from an acute migraine headache or those with milder symptoms who do not respond to simple analgesics.
[10] Triptans have been shown to be effective for both pain and nausea in up to 75% of people.
[157][158]  There are different methods or routes of administration to take sumatriptan including oral (by mouth), injectable (subcutaneous), rectal, nasal spray, and oral dissolving tablets.
[5][159][160][161] For people with migraine symptoms such as nausea or vomitting, taking the abortive medicine by mouth or through the nose may be difficult.
All route of administration have been shown to be effective at reducing migraine symptoms, however, nasal and injectable subcutaneous administration may result in more side effects.
[161][160] The adverse effects associated with rectal administration have not been well studied.
[159] Some people may find that they respond to one type of sumatripton better than another.
[10] Most side effects are mild, including flushing; however, rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred.
[5] They are thus not recommended for people with cardiovascular disease,[10] who have had a stroke, or have migraines that are accompanied by neurological problems.
[162] In addition, triptans should be prescribed with caution for those with risk factors for vascular disease.
[162] While historically not recommended in those with basilar migraines there is no specific evidence of harm from their use in this population to support this caution.
[47] Triptans are not addictive, but may cause medication-overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month.
[163] Sumatriptan does not prevent other migraine headaches from starting in the future.
[160] For increased effectiveness at stopping migraine symptoms, a combined therapy that includes sumatriptan and naproxen may be suggested.
[164]  CGRP receptor antagonists[edit] CGRP receptor antagonists target calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor to prevent migraine headaches or reduce their severity.
[38] CGRP is a signaling molecule as well as a potent vasodilator that is involved in the development of a migraine headache.
[38] There are four injectable monoclonal antibodies that target CGRP or it's receptor (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) and the medications have demonstrated efficacy in the preventative treatment of episodic and chronic migraine headaches in phase 3 randomized clinical trials.
[38] Eptinezumab is available as an infusion every three months, Erenumab and galcanezumab are once monthly injections and fremanezumab is a monthly or quarterly injection.
Ergotamines[edit] Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are older medications still prescribed for migraines, the latter in nasal spray and injectable forms.
[5][165] They appear equally effective to the triptans[166] and experience adverse effects that typically are benign.
[167] In the most severe cases, such as those with status migrainosus, they appear to be the most effective treatment option.
[167] They can cause vasospasm including coronary vasospasm and are contraindicated in people with coronary artery disease.
[168]  Magnesium[edit] Magnesium is recognized as an inexpensive, over-the-counter supplement which some studies have shown to be effective in both preventing and treating migraine in intravenous form.
[169]  Other[edit] Intravenous metoclopramide, intravenous prochlorperazine, or intranasal lidocaine are other potential options.
[10][155] Metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are the recommended treatment for those who present to the emergency department.
[10][155] Haloperidol may also be useful in this group.
[155][165] A single dose of intravenous dexamethasone, when added to standard treatment of a migraine attack, is associated with a 26% decrease in headache recurrence in the following 72 hours.
[170] Spinal manipulation for treating an ongoing migraine headache is not supported by evidence.
[128] It is recommended that opioids and barbiturates not be used due to questionable efficacy, addictive potential, and the risk of rebound headache.
[10][38] There is tentative evidence that propofol may be useful if other measures are not effective.
[171] Occipital nerve stimulation, may be effective but has the downsides of being cost-expensive and has a significant amount of complications.
[172] There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of non-invasive neuromodulatory devices, behavioral therapies and acupuncture in the treatment of migraine headaches.
[38] There is little to no evidence for the effectiveness of physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation and dietary approaches to the treatment of migraine headaches.
[38] Behavioral treatment of migraine headaches may be helpful for those who may not be able to take medications (for example pregnant women).
[38] Feverfew is registered as a traditional herbal medicine in the Nordic countries under the brand name Glitinum, only powdered feverfew is approved in the Herbal community monograph issued by European Medicines Agency (EMA).
Sexual activity, particularly orgasm, may provide relief for some migraineurs.
[173]  Children[edit] Ibuprofen helps decrease pain in children with migraines and is the initially recommended treatment.
[174][175] Paracetamol does not appear to be effective in providing pain relief.
[174] Triptans are effective, though there is a risk of causing minor side effects like taste disturbance, nasal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, low energy, nausea, or vomiting.
[174][176] Ibuprofen should be used less than half the days in a month and triptans less than a third of the days in a month to decrease the risk of medication overuse headache.
[175]  Chronic migraine[edit] Topiramate and botulinum toxin (Botox) have evidence in treating chronic migraine.
[121][177] Botulinum toxin has been found to be useful in those with chronic migraine but not those with episodic ones.
[178][179] The anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody erenumab was found in one study to decrease chronic migraines by 2.4 days more than placebo.
[180]  Prognosis[edit] "Migraine exists on a continuum of different attack frequencies and associated levels of disability.
"[181] For those with occasional, episodic migraine, a "proper combination of drugs for prevention and treatment of migraine attacks" can limit the disease's impact on patients' personal and professional lives.
[182]  But fewer than half of people with migraine seek medical care and more than half go undiagnosed and undertreated.
[183] "Responsive prevention and treatment of migraine is incredibly important" because evidence shows "an increased sensitivity after each successive attack, eventually leading to chronic daily migraine in some individuals.
"[182] Repeated migraine results in "reorganization of brain circuitry," causing "profound functional as well as structural changes in the brain.
"[184] "One of the most important problems in clinical migraine is the progression from an intermittent, self-limited inconvenience to a life-changing disorder of chronic pain, sensory amplification, and autonomic and affective disruption.
This progression, sometimes termed chronification in the migraine literature, is common, affecting 3% of migraineurs in a given year, such that 8% of migraineurs have chronic migraine in any given year."
Brain imagery reveals that the electrophysiological changes seen during an attack become permanent in people with chronic migraine; "thus, from an electrophysiological point of view, chronic migraine indeed resembles a never-ending migraine attack.
"[184] Severe migraine ranks in the highest category of disability, according to the World Health Organization, which uses objective metrics to determine disability burden for the authoritative annual Global Burden of Disease report.
The report classifies severe migraine alongside severe depression, active psychosis, quadriplegia, and terminal-stage cancer.
[185] Migraine with aura appears to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke[186] doubling the risk.
[187] Being a young adult, being female, using hormonal birth control, and smoking further increases this risk.
[186] There also appears to be an association with cervical artery dissection.
[188] Migraine without aura does not appear to be a factor.
[189] The relationship with heart problems is inconclusive with a single study supporting an association.
[186] Migraine does not appear to increase the risk of death from stroke or heart disease.
[190] Preventative therapy of migraines in those with migraine with aura may prevent associated strokes.
[191] People with migraine, particularly women, may develop higher than average numbers of white matter brain lesions of unclear significance.

[11] It is more common in women at 19% than men at 11%.
[11] In the United States, about 6% of men and 18% of women experience a migraine attack in a given year, with a lifetime risk of about 18% and 43% respectively.
[5] In Europe, migraines affect 12–28% of people at some point in their lives with about 6–15% of adult men and 14–35% of adult women getting at least one yearly.
[17] Rates of migraine are slightly lower in Asia and Africa than in Western countries.
[58][193] Chronic migraine occurs in approximately 1.4 to 2.2% of the population.
[194] These figures vary substantially with age: onset of migraine is most commonly between 15 and 24 years of age, and occur most frequently in those 35 to 45 years of age.
[5] In children, about 1.7% of 7 year olds and 3.9% of those between 7 and 15 experience migraine, with the condition being slightly more common in boys before puberty.
[195] Children as young as two years may be affected.
[174] During adolescence, migraine becomes more common among women[195] and this persists for the rest of the lifespan, being twice as common among elderly females than males.
[196] In women migraine without aura are more common than migraine with aura; however in men the two types occur with similar frequency.
[58] During perimenopause symptoms often get worse before decreasing in severity.
[196] While symptoms resolve in about two thirds of the elderly, in 3 to 10% they persist.
[49]  History[edit]   The Head Ache, George Cruikshank (1819) An early description consistent with migraine is contained in the Ebers papyrus, written around 1500 BCE in ancient Egypt.
[24] In 200 BCE, writings from the Hippocratic school of medicine described the visual aura that can precede the headache and a partial relief occurring through vomiting.
[197] A second-century description by Aretaeus of Cappadocia divided headaches into three types: cephalalgia, cephalea, and heterocrania.
[198] Galen of Pergamon used the term hemicrania (half-head), from which the word migraine was eventually derived.
[198] He also proposed that the pain arose from the meninges and blood vessels of the head.
[197] Migraine was first divided into the two now used types – migraine with aura (migraine ophthalmique) and migraine without aura (migraine vulgaire) in 1887 by Louis Hyacinthe Thomas, a French Librarian.
[197] The mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen, which she described as “reflections of the living light", are consistent with the visual aura experienced during migraines.
[199]    A trepanated skull, from the Neolithic.
The perimeter of the hole in the skull is rounded off by ingrowth of new bony tissue, indicating that the person survived the operation.
Trepanation, the deliberate drilling of holes into a skull, was practiced as early as 7,000 BCE.
[24] While sometimes people survived, many would have died from the procedure due to infection.
[200] It was believed to work via "letting evil spirits escape".
[201] William Harvey recommended trepanation as a treatment for migraines in the 17th century.
[202] While many treatments for migraine have been attempted, it was not until 1868 that use of a substance which eventually turned out to be effective began.
[197] This substance was the fungus ergot from which ergotamine was isolated in 1918.
[203] Methysergide was developed in 1959 and the first triptan, sumatriptan, was developed in 1988.
[203] During the 20th century with better study-design, effective preventive measures were found and confirmed.
[197]  Society and culture[edit] Migraine is a significant source of both medical costs and lost productivity.
It has been estimated that migraine is the most costly neurological disorder in the European Community, costing more than €27 billion per year.
[204] In the United States, direct costs have been estimated at $17 billion, while indirect costs — such as missed or decreased ability to work — is estimated at $15 billion.
[205] Nearly a tenth of the direct cost is due to the cost of triptans.
[205] In those who do attend work with a migraine, effectiveness is decreased by around a third.
[204] Negative impacts also frequently occur for a person's family.
[204]  Research[edit] Potential prevention mechanisms[edit] Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows promise[10][206] as does transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation.
[207] There is preliminary evidence that a ketogenic diet may help prevent episodic and long-term migraine.
[208][209]  Potential gender dependency[edit] While no definitive proof has been found linking migraine to gender, statistical data indicates that women may be more prone to suffer from migraine, showing migraine incidence three times higher among women than men.
[210][211] The Society for Women’s Health Research has also mentioned hormonal influences, mainly estrogen, as having a considerable role in provoking migraine pain.
Studies and research related to the gender dependencies of migraine are still ongoing, and conclusions have yet to be achieved.

The main symptom of a migraine is usually an intense headache on 1 side of the head.
The pain is usually a moderate or severe throbbing sensation that gets worse when you move and prevents you carrying out normal activities.
In some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck.
Additional symptoms Other symptoms commonly associated with a migraine include:  feeling sick  being sick  increased sensitivity to light and sound, which is why many people with a migraine want to rest in a quiet, dark room   Some people also occasionally experience other symptoms, including:  sweating  poor concentration,  feeling very hot or very cold  tummy (abdominal) pain diarrhoea  Not everyone with a migraine experiences these additional symptoms and some people may experience them without having a headache.
The symptoms of a migraine usually last between 4 hours and 3 days, although you may feel very tired for up to a week afterwards.
Symptoms of aura About 1 in 3 people with migraines have temporary warning symptoms, known as aura, before a migraine.
These include:  visual problems – such as seeing flashing lights, zig-zag patterns or blind spots  numbness or a tingling sensation like pins and needles – which usually starts in 1 hand and moves up your arm before affecting your face, lips and tongue  feeling dizzy or off balance  difficulty speaking  loss of consciousness – although this is unusual   Aura symptoms typically develop over the course of about 5 minutes and last for up to an hour.
Some people may experience aura followed by only a mild headache or no headache at all.
When to get medical advice You should see a GP if you have frequent or severe migraine symptoms that cannot be managed with occasional use of over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol.
Try not to use the maximum dosage of painkillers on a regular or frequent basis as this could make it harder to treat headaches over time.
You should also make an appointment to see a GP if you have frequent migraines (on more than 5 days a month), even if they can be controlled with medicine, as you may benefit from preventative treatment.
You should call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone you're with experiences:  paralysis or weakness in 1 or both arms or 1 side of the face  slurred or garbled speech  a sudden agonising headache resulting in a severe pain unlike anything experienced before  headache along with a high temperature (fever), stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision and a rash   These symptoms may be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a stroke or meningitis, and should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible.
Find out more about diagnosing migraines Stages of a migraine Migraines often develop in distinct stages, although not everyone goes through all of these:  prodromal (pre-headache) stage – changes in mood, energy levels, behaviour and appetite that can occur several hours or days before an attack  aura – usually visual problems, such as flashes of light or blind spots, which can last for 5 minutes to an hour  headache stage – usually a pulsating or throbbing pain on 1 side of the head, often accompanied by feeling sick, vomiting or extreme sensitivity to bright light and loud sounds, which can last for 4 to 72 hours  resolution stage – when the headache and other symptoms gradually fade away, although you may feel tired for a few days afterwards                                       Page last reviewed: 10 May 2019     Next review due: 10 May 2022                                    Previous         :         Migraine                                                                    Next         :         Causes What are migraine symptoms?A migraine isn’t just an average headache.
Migraines are strong, pounding headaches typically on one side of the head.Migraines usually include several other symptoms.
They’re sometimes preceded by warning symptoms called aura.
These symptoms may include flashes of light, visual “floaters,” or tingling sensations in your arms and legs.Migraine episodes, which can last for hours or days, can greatly affect your life.
According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,Trusted Source migraines are experienced by 12 percent of the U.S. adult population.
Many of these migraines are caused by the activation of nerve fibers in the blood vessels of the brain.The classic migraine evolves through four separate stage.
Each stage has different symptoms.
These stages include:the prodrome (premonitory) stagethe aura (visual symptoms or tingling)the headache (main attack) stagethe postdrome (recovery) stageNot all people who get migraines experience all of the stages.
Prodrome stageThe premonitory or prodrome stage can start anywhere from one hour to two days before your migraine begins.
Symptoms that may indicate that a migraine is coming on include:fatiguemood changes, such as anxiety or depressionthirstcraving for sugary foodstight or sore neckconstipationirritabilityfrequent yawningHEALTHLINE NEWSLETTERGet our weekly Migraine emailTo help you treat and manage this challenging condition, we'll send you trusted remedies, coping techniques, and expert advice.Enter your emailSIGN UP NOWAlso sign up for our popular Heart Health newsletterYour privacy is important to us Aura stageThe aura stage happens right before or during a migraine.
Auras are usually visual disturbances, but can involve other sensations.
Symptoms build up gradually and last for about 20 to 60 minutes.
About 30 percent of people who experience migraine have migraine with aura.Symptoms of an aura can include:seeing bright spots or flashes of light vision loss or seeing dark spotstingling sensations in an arm or leg described as “pins and needles”speech problems or inability to speak (aphasia)ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Main attack stageThe attack stage includes the headache and other symptoms.
It can last for a few hours to a few days.During an attack, you might experience the following symptoms:pulsating or throbbing pain on one or both sides of the headextreme sensitivity to light, sounds, or smellsworsening pain during physical activitynausea and vomitingabdominal pain or heartburnloss of appetitelightheadednessblurred visionfaintingIf you have a migraine, you’ll often feel the need to lie down in the dark and quiet to escape from light, sounds, and movement.
This is one of the main differences between migraines and other types of headaches.
Fortunately, you may find that sleeping for an hour or two can help end an attack.ADVERTISEMENTMigraine relief is just a click away!Cove pairs you directly with a licensed doctor who can recommend the right clinically-proven treatment for your unique needs.

The migraine fades slowly.
Some people report feelings of euphoria.
Migraines vs. tension headachesTension headaches and migraines may cause very similar symptoms.
Migraine symptoms tend to be more severe than tension headaches.With a tension headache, your pain is usually mild to moderate throughout your head, and disappears within a few hours.
Migraines tend to last longer and are often debilitating.Tension headaches don’t typically cause any visual side effects like aura or physical side effects like nausea or vomiting.
Tension headaches can make you feel sensitive to light or sound but usually not both.
Sinus headaches are often confused for migraines because they share many symptoms, including pressure in the sinuses and watery eyes.
Sinus headaches are usually only moderately painful and can be treated with sinus treatments or other allergy medications.
Migraines vs. cluster headachesCluster headaches differ from migraines mainly in that they follow patterns of occurrence.
They “cluster” together in short, episodic attacks during a period of weeks or months.
Sometimes, an entire year can pass between two headache clusters.
Migraines tend not to follow this kind of pattern.Symptoms of migraines and cluster headaches are similar.
In both cases, pain is severe.
Cluster headaches can cause many distinct symptoms that migraines don’t cause, including:red, bloodshot eyesswelling of the eyelids (edema)shrinking of the pupil (miosis)runny nose or congestion drooping of the eyelids (ptosis)agitation, annoyance, or restlessness during a headache If you observe any of these symptoms during a severe headache, you’re likely experiencing a cluster headache, not a migraine.
Your doctor can usually diagnose cluster headaches by examining the nerves in your eye or discovering an abnormality during MRI scans linked to cluster headaches.
Talk to your doctor about getting checked for cluster headaches if you have these symptoms.
Relief and treatmentMedications for pain relief may be enough to treat your symptoms.
Common pain relievers that can help migraine symptoms include:ibuprofenaspirinacetaminophen (Tylenol)Excedrin (aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine)If your pain continues, talk to your doctor about other treatment options.
Migraine preventionIf you have at least six migraines per month or three migraines a month that severely interfere with your daily life, your doctor may recommend preventive medications that are effective against migraine symptoms, including:beta-blockers, such as propranolol or timolol, for high blood pressure or coronary diseasescalcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, for high blood pressuretricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, for controlling serotonin and other chemicals in your brainantiseizure drugs, such as valproate (in moderate doses)pain relievers, such as naproxenCGRP antagonists, a new class of drugs approved to prevent migrainesThere can be side effects of these medications.
Also, talk to your doctor about lifestyle changes that can help decrease migraines.
Things like quitting smoking, getting plenty of sleep, avoiding triggers from certain foods, and staying hydrated can be useful.
Some alternative medicines are often used to aid in relieving migraine symptoms, including:acupuncturecognitive behavioral therapy, a type of therapy that instructs you on how your behavior and thinking can change the way you perceive your migraine painherbs, such as feverfewriboflavin (B-2) magnesium supplements (if you have low levels of magnesium in your body)Your doctor may recommend that you try these alternative options if medicinal treatments aren’t working for you or if you want to take greater control of preventive care for your migraines.
Migraines in children and teensAround 10 percent of children and teens experience migraines.
Symptoms are generally similar to migraines in adults.
Teens are also more likely to have chronic migraine (CM), which causes migraines for several hours a day for over 15 days of the month across three or more months.
CM may cause your child to miss school or social activities.Migraines can be passed on genetically.
If you or your child’s other biological parent has a history of migraines, your child has a 50 percent chance of having them.
If both you and the other parent have a migraine history, your child has a 75 percent chance.
Plus, many things can trigger your child’s migraines, including:stresscaffeinemedications, including birth control and asthma treatmentroutine changesFind out what’s causing your child’s migraine, then talk to your doctor about the best way to treat and prevent migraines.
In addition to medications, your doctor may recommend relaxation techniques and preventive therapy so that your child can better understand and manage their migraines.
OutlookMigraine pain can be severe, and often unbearable.
Depression is more likely to occur in those who experience migraines than those who do not.

Here’s our process.Migraine is a medical condition that involves severe, recurring headaches and other symptoms.
A migraine episode is a type of headache.
An episode usually occurs in stages and can last for several days.
Severe cases can affect a person’s daily life, including their ability to work or study.Migraine can affect people in different ways, and the triggers, severity, symptoms, and frequency can vary.
Some people have more than one episode each week, while others have them only occasionally.In 2018, researchers found that more than 15%Trusted Source of adults in the United States had experienced a migraine episode or a severe headache within the last 3 months.
Research from 2015 found that migraine affects just over 19%Trusted Source of females and 9% of males.
Episodes often occur in people aged 18–44 years, but they can happen at any time, including during childhood.SymptomsShare on PinterestEujarim Photography/Getty ImagesSymptoms of migraine tend to occur in stages:Before the headache: According to research from 2008, 20–60%Trusted Source of people with migraine experience symptoms that start hours or days before the headache.
At this stage, a person might experience a “prodrome,” which may involve emotional changes, specifically depression and irritability.
A prodrome can also include yawning, dizziness, thirst, frequent urination, and sensitivity to light and sound.
Sometimes an aura can occur.
This involves physical or sensory symptoms, such as flashing lights in the field of vision.
During the headache: Alongside a mild to severe, throbbing or pulsing headache, symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, neck pain, dizziness, and nasal congestion.
Resolution: After the headache, tiredness and irritability may last another 2 days.
This is sometimes called the “migraine hangover.” Other common features of migraine are:head pain that worsens during physical activity or strainingan inability to perform regular activities due to the painincreased sensitivity to light and sound that can sometimes be relived by lying quietly in a darkened room Other symptoms may include sweating, feeling unusually hot or cold, a stomachache, and diarrhea.Find out what else can cause a headache, nausea, and fatigue here.Migraine vs. headacheA migraine episode is different from a typical headache.
The experience is different, and they can have different causes.Writing down the symptoms and when they occur can help a person and their healthcare professional identify migraine episodes.
Keep this journal for at least 8 weeks, and note down:the time that symptoms startpossible triggers, such as stress or menstruationthe nature of the headacheany other symptomshow long the symptoms lastany noticeable indicators of migraine, such as an auraany medications and their effectsLearn more about the differences between migraine and a headache here.Causes and triggersExperts think that migraine episodes may stem from changes in the brain that affect the: way nerves communicatebalance of chemicals blood vesselsGenetic features may also play a role — having a family historyTrusted Source of migraine is a common risk factor.Migraine triggers vary from person to person.
They commonly include:hormonal changes, such as those related to menstruationemotional triggers, such as stress, depression, anxiety, and excitementdietary factors, including alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, nuts, cheese, citrus fruits, and foods containing the additives tyramine and monosodium glutamate (MSG)medications, such as sleeping pills, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and some birth control pillsenvironmental factors, including flickering screens, strong smells, secondhand smoke, loud noises, humidity, stuffy rooms, temperature changes, and bright lightsSome other possible triggers include:tirednessa lack of sleepshoulder and neck tensionpoor posturephysical overexertionlow blood sugarjet lagirregular mealtimesdehydrationAvoiding triggers, when possible, may help reduce the frequency of migraine episodes.What causes headaches?

Get 50% off your first month now.GET RELIEF NOWResearch data on race and ethnicityMigraine can be a debilitating condition that is underdiagnosed and challenging to treat.
This can be seen especially in BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) populations.
People of Color are less likely to receive the diagnosis of migraine and the treatment than white people.
In fact, only 47% of African AmericansTrusted Source have an official migraine diagnosis, compared with 70% of white people in the country.
And other research found that Latino people are 50% less likely to receive a formal migraine diagnosis than white people.
These disparities can impact treatment and therapies.
While these figures could lead to the conclusion that white people experience more migraine episodes than other groups, an analysis of nine studiesTrusted Source looking at the average prevalence of severe headache or migraine from 2005 to 2012 in the U.S. found that the prevalence rates of episodes across all groups were similar:17.7% of Native American people15.5% of white people14.5% of Hispanic people14.45% of Black people9.2% of Asian people Furthermore, females in all groups were approximately twice as likely to experience migraine episodes than males.
Overall, studies that discuss migraine and use racial and ethnic differences for clarity often do not consider contributing factors.
Further research is warranted, and this should consider behavioral, environmental, genetic, and socioeconomic factors, as well as access to healthcare.Risk factorsAnyone can develop migraine, and there is a slightly higher risk for people with:depressionbipolar disorderfibromyalgiairritable bowel syndromeoveractive bladdersleep disordersobsessive-compulsive disorderanxietyIs there a link between migraine and COVID-19?TreatmentThere is no cure for migraine.
However, medications can treat the symptoms when they arise, and people can take steps to reduce the frequency and severity of episodes.
But keep in mind that these medications can have side effects.MedicationsPain relief and other types of medication can often help.
Taking medication as soon as symptoms start may keep them from becoming severe.Some over-the-counter pain relief medications that may benefit people with migraine include:naproxen (Aleve)ibuprofen (Advil)acetaminophen (Tylenol)Other options include:triptans, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex), to help reverse the brain changes that occur during an episodeantiemetics to manage any nausea and vomitinggepants to block a protein involved in inflammation and pain, called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)ditans, which interact with 5-HT1F receptors on the sensory nerves and blood vesselsIt is important to avoid overusing medication because overuse can cause a rebound headache.
A healthcare professional can help a person decide how much of each medication is safe and effective.

The best treatment in children or adolescents may be different from that in adults.
A healthcare professional can help recommend the most effective approach.Identifying and avoiding triggersA migraine episode sometimes happens in response to a trigger.
To identify a trigger, a person might keep a diary and record how they felt and what they did, ate, and drank before the symptoms appeared.It may be particularly helpful to avoid: low blood sugarphysical overexertionstresscertain foods, such as chocolate and any that contain tyramine or MSGcertain medications, including HRT and some birth control pillsbright lights and flickering screensThe following strategies may help reduce the frequency of migraine episodes:getting enough sleepreducing stressdrinking plenty of waterhaving healthy postureavoiding known dietary triggers, such as caffeine, alcohol, and cheesegetting regular physical exerciseIf making these changes does not ease the severity and frequency of migraine episodes, a doctor may suggest medication or other options.
To discover more evidence-based information and resources for headache and migraine, visit our dedicated hub.TypesThere are various types of migraine.
A major distinguishing factor is whether they involve aura — sensory changes.
Migraine with auraAura is a disturbance of the senses in the early stages of a migraine episode.Aura can involve:having confusing thoughts or experiencesseeing strange, sparkling, or flashing lights that are not thereseeing zig-zagging lines of lighthaving blind spots or blank patches in the field of visionhaving a pins and needles sensation in an arm or leghaving difficulty speakinghaving weakness in the shoulders, neck, or limbsseeing things that are not there out of one eye, such as transparent strings of objectsnot being able to see part of something clearlyhaving part of the field of vision disappear, then reappearA visual aura may feel like the aftermath of a very bright camera flash, but the visual changes may last for several minutes or up to 1 hour.
Anyone experiencing an aura for the first time should contact a healthcare professional to rule out serious neurological problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor.Find out more about migraine aura here.Migraine without auraMore commonly, a person experiences no sensory disturbances before an episode.
According to the Migraine Trust, 70–90% of episodes occur without aura.Other typesSome other types of migraine include:Chronic migraine: This involves having an episode on more than 15 days per month.Menstrual migraine: This occurs in a pattern that follows the menstrual cycle.Hemiplegic migraine: This causes temporary weakness on one side of the body, and it is very rare.Abdominal migraine: This involves migraine episodes with irregular function in the gut and abdomen, often with nausea or vomiting.
It mainly affects children under 14 years of age.Vestibular migraine: Severe vertigo is a symptom of this type.Basilar migraine: This rare type is also called “migraine with brainstem aura,” and it can affect neurological functions, such as speech.
Anyone who may be experiencing any neurological symptoms should get medical attention.
And people who need treatment for migraine should consult a healthcare professional.DiagnosisThe International Headache Society recommends the “5, 4, 3, 2, 1” criteria to diagnose migraine without aura.
These numbers stand for:having 5 or more episodes, each lasting 4 hours to 3 dayshaving a headache with at least 2 of the following qualities: – occurring on one side– pulsating– causing moderate-to-severe pain aggravated by activityhaving at least 1 additional symptom, such as: – nausea– vomiting– sensitivity to light– sensitivity to soundThe doctor may recommend imaging or other tests to exclude other causes of the symptoms, such as a tumor, meningitis, or a stroke.
When to see a doctorA person should consult a healthcare professional if they experience: what seems like a first migraine episode worsening or unusual migraine symptomssevere symptomsIf any of the following occur, seek immediate medical help:an unusually severe headachevisual disturbancesa loss of sensationdifficulty speakingThese could indicate another condition that may need urgent attention, such as a stroke.
When is it sensible to worry about a headache?SummaryMigraine is a medical condition that involves a headache and other symptoms.
It is not just a bad headache, and it can have a significant impact on daily life, making it difficult to work and do everyday activities.
Identifying and avoiding triggers can often help reduce the frequency or severity of episodes, though it is not always possible to prevent them.Medication and other treatments can help manage migraine symptoms.

Individual migraines are moderate to severe in intensity, often characterized by a throbbing or pounding feeling.
Although they are frequently one-sided, they may occur anywhere on the head, neck and face — or all over.
At their worst, they are typically associated with sensitivity to light, noise and/or smells.
Nausea is one of the most common symptoms and it worsens with activity, which often results in patient disability.
In many respects, migraines are much like alcohol-related hangovers.
Migraine pain can be felt in the face, where it may be mistaken for sinus headache — or in the neck, where it may be mistaken for arthritis or muscle spasm.
Complicating the diagnosis of migraine is that the headaches may be accompanied by other "sinus like" symptoms, including watering eyes, nasal congestion and a sense of facial pressure.
Most patients who think they have sinus headache in fact have migraines.
In up to 25 percent of patients, the migraine headache pain may be preceded by an aura, a temporary neurological syndrome that slowly progresses and then typically resolves just as the pain begins.
While the most common type of migraine aura involves visual disturbances (flashing lights, zigzags, blind spots), many people experience numbness, confusion, trouble speaking, vertigo (spinning dizziness) and other strokelike neurological symptoms.
Some patients may experience auras without headaches.
How prevalent are migraines?
Migraines are about three times more common in women than men, and may affect more than 12 percent of the U.S. adult population.
Migraines often run in families, and can start as early as elementary school but most often in early adulthood.
They often fade away later in life, but can strike at any time.
The most common cause of recurring, disabling headache pain, migraines are also the most common underlying cause of disabling chronic, daily headache pain.
While migraines are the No.
1 reason that patients see a neurologist, most cases are handled by primary care physicians.
What triggers a migraine?
Things that can make the headaches more likely to occur include:           Alcohol               Weather changes               Lack of sleep               Schedule changes               Dehydration               Hunger               Certain foods               Strong smells               Teeth grinding at night               Menstruation       How are migraines diagnosed?
Despite their dramatic symptoms, migraines are almost never due to an underlying problem that will show up on any testing, even on brain MRIs.
Many experts do not recommend brain imaging at all, even in severe cases, as long as the patient's symptoms are typical for migraines and a thorough neurological examination is normal.
There are extremely rare families that have migraines as a result of a single genetic mutation in one of four known genes that can lead to the condition called familial hemiplegic migraine.
There are no genetic tests for the vast majority of patients.
Because the condition cannot be diagnosed by scan or blood test, the diagnosis is "clinical" — made by an experienced physician.
How are migraines treated?
Migraines that are severe, frequent or accompanied by neurological symptoms are best treated preventively, usually with a combination of dietary modification, lifestyle changes, vitamins and daily prescription medications.
Most of our best preventive medications are often used for other medical purposes as well; the majority are blood pressure drugs, antidepressants or epilepsy medications.
Individual headache attacks are best treated early, often with one or more of the following types of medications: triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-emetics (anti-nausea), and sometimes narcotics or steroids.
Migraines typically last a few hours to a couple of days and respond well to specific treatments.
However, in some patients, the migraine is particularly severe and long-lasting — and may even become chronic, occurring continuously for weeks, months or even years.
If improperly managed or left untreated, intermittent migraines may essentially transform into a chronic daily headache, with continuous and smoldering symptoms that periodically erupt into a "full-blown" migraine.
This condition is extremely difficult to treat.
Other patients may develop increasingly frequent headaches as a result of overusing their short-acting headache medications.
See medication overuse headache.
While they are considered primary headaches, meaning they have no known underlying cause, migraines are associated with an increased risk of stroke, brain scarring as seen on MRI scans, a heart defect called a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and other medical conditions.
At the Johns Hopkins Headache Center, located at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical center, we have expert physical therapists, nutritionists and psychologists who work closely with our neurologists to help manage patients with frequent migraines.

You can experience up to four phases during a migraine episode, each of which can be recognized by its own set of characteristics.
Your migraine attacks may not all be exactly the same, but recognizing the range of symptoms that can occur can help tip you off as to if what you're experiencing could be a migraine.
If you're already diagnosed, knowing where these symptoms fit into the typical sequence of stages can help you decide when to take your medication.
Migraines may result in medication-related complications, and rarely, a migraine can induce a serious health complication.
Other conditions, such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) can produce symptoms similar to those of a migraine, so you may need to seek medical attention if you have any warning signs.

Frequent Symptoms    Migraine episodes can include several stages: prodome, aura, headache, and postdrome.
You may cycle through all of these phases when you have a migraine, or you might experience just one, two, or three of them.
The headache phase is the most common, while the aura is the least common.
Prodrome    The prodrome is characterized by premonitory symptoms of an impending migraine and it can begin hours or days before a migraine episode reaches its peak intensity.
Most people with migraine experience prodromal symptoms, and taking migraine medication during this stage may stop the episode from progressing.
Typical symptoms during a prodrome are:1﻿          Food cravings Constipation or diarrhea Mood changes: sadness, irritability, anxiety Muscle stiffness or soreness, especially in the neck Fatigue Excessive yawning Nausea Fluid retention, bloating Increased frequency of urination Difficulty concentrating Vivid dreams Sensitivity to light, sounds, or smells Feeling cold           Aura    Approximately one-third of migraineurs experience aura, which usually follows the prodrome and lasts for less than an hour.2﻿ This stage is characterized by neurological symptoms, and it can be quite terrifying, especially when you experience it for the first time.
Symptoms of a migraine aura can include:    Visual changes: flashing lights, wavy lines, spots, partial loss of vision, blind spot, blurry vision Tingling, numbness, or hypersensitivity of the face or extremities Vertigo (a sense that the room is spinning) Difficulty finding words and/or speaking Confusion Partial paralysis Olfactory hallucinations (smelling odors that aren't there) Auditory hallucinations (hearing things that are not there) A decrease or loss of hearing          An Overview of Migraine With Aura     Headache    The head pain of a migraine is often described as throbbing, pounding, or pulsating.
You may also experience other symptoms along with the head pain.
This phase usually lasts from four to 72 hours.1﻿    Common characteristics of the headache phase may include:    Hemicranial (on one side of the head) pain that can shift to the other side or become bilateral Phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) Photophobia (sensitivity to light) Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea or constipation Nasal congestion and/or runny nose Sadness or anxiety Hot flashes and chills Dizziness Dehydration or fluid retention     Migraine effects are not limited to the head and often affect the neck, shoulders, arms, or the entire body.
The symptoms are often worsened by activities such as walking, riding in a car, or exercising.
Postdrome    After the most intense phase of a migraine, you may experience a postdrome before your migraine attack is completely over.
The symptoms of postdrome include:1﻿    FatigueMood changes, which can include sadness, anxiety, or elevated moodMuscle achesDizziness or lightheadednessDifficulty concentratingStiff neckScalp tenderness    Many people describe postdrome as feeling "like a zombie" or hungover.
Postdromal symptoms can be associated with abnormal cerebral blood flow and electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns for up to 24 hours after the end of the headache stage.3﻿ Even if you do not experience the headache stage, you may still experience a postdrome phase.
Concurrent Phases  Migraine stages may overlap, sometimes with the aura occurring at the same time as the prodrome, headache, or postdrome.
Prodromal symptoms may linger even as the headache peaks, and postdromal symptoms can begin before the headache starts to resolve.
Childhood Migraines    Children also experience migraines, and the symptoms can differ from those of adults.
If you note the following symptoms in your child, migraines may be the cause, especially if your child has a family history of the condition:4    StomachacheNauseaDizzinessMotion sicknessMoodinessExcessive sleepiness    Be sure to discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider.
They could be signs of another medical condition, but if migraines are the cause, your child can take medication to help prevent and treat episodes.
When Children Have Migraines      Rare Symptoms    Rare symptoms are typically associated with migraine subtypes, and while they may be similar to a migraine aura, the main difference is that these unusual symptoms are usually the most prominent aspect of the migraine episodes.
Weakness    Weakness, typically in one arm, occurs with hemiplegic migraine.5﻿ If you have hemiplegic migraines, you may also experience several migraine stages and other aura symptoms.
There is a strong hereditary tendency to develop this type of migraine.
Stomachaches    More common in children than adults, abdominal migraine is characterized by stomachaches that occur without a gastrointestinal cause and may involve nausea and vomiting.
Paralysis of Eye Movement    Double vision, blurred vision, a droopy eyelid, or an obvious inability to move one eye can be a sign of ophthalmoplegic migraine.
Absent Headache    Although not very common, you can have a migraine aura without a headache.
There are several terms used to describe this experience, including "silent migraine," "sans-migraine," and "migraine equivalent."
When There's No Headache, Is It Still a Migraine?
Complications/ Sub-Group Indications    Migraines do not typically cause complications, although they can.
The most common complications are related to medication use.
Medication Effects    Side effects of overuse can include stomach pain and gastrointestinal bleeding from taking high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs).
Other medications, including triptans and ergot medications, can cause side effects such as dizziness, tingling, or even vascular complications when taken at higher doses than directed.
Keep in mind that all medications—whether over-the-counter or prescription— can cause side effects even at recommended doses.
Medication rebound headaches or medication withdrawal headaches can occur when you take migraine medications at high doses or for a prolonged time and then abruptly stop.
Be sure to discuss a medication plan with your healthcare provider—and if it isn't working, then discuss another plan instead of taking extra medication to deal with your migraines.
Medications That Cause Overuse Headaches     Migraine Complications    Complications from a migraine itself include some serious concerns that require medical attention:    Status migrainosus: If your migraine lasts longer than 72 hours despite treatment, it's termed status migrainosus, a condition that is unlikely to resolve with your regular prescription.
You should seek medical attention because you may need treatment with intravenous (IV) medication.6﻿    Migrainous infarction: An infarction in the brain is a type of stroke caused by lack of blood flow.
A migrainous infarction begins with migraine symptoms that can eventually involve stroke symptoms and may produce permanent neurological effects.
Seizure: A convulsive episode that may be characterized by involuntary shaking or jerking may occur as a result of a migraine.
The physiological reason for this complication is not well understood.
Migraine Complications      When to See a Healthcare Provider/Go to the Hospital    Migraines do not normally require emergency medical attention.
The treatment is really based on a plan for both prevention and treatment of acute attacks.
Nevertheless, when you are not sure if your symptoms are caused by a migraine, or when your migraine pattern changes, you need to seek medical attention.
Urgent Medical Care    Symptoms such as paralysis, loss of sensation, difficulty communicating, loss of vision, and double vision can all be manifestations of a stroke, MS, meningitis, seizures, and other neurological illnesses.7﻿ If you experience any of these rare symptoms and they have not been attributed to migraines (or if you're unsure of their connection), then you should get prompt medical attention.
Even if you have a diagnosis of migraines, you should have a medical evaluation if your headaches occur with certain features, including:    The worst headache of your lifeFeversRecurrent vomiting/can't keep anything downHead traumaFalling/ inability to balance     Talk to Your Healthcare Provider    If your migraine pattern changes in frequency or intensity or if your symptoms change, you should talk to your healthcare provider.
You may need a diagnostic evaluation or a change in your treatment plan.

It's often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound.
Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so severe that it interferes with your daily activities.
For some people, a warning symptom known as an aura occurs before or with the headache.
An aura can include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking.
Medications can help prevent some migraines and make them less painful.

Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages.
ProdromeOne or two days before a migraine, you might notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including:      Constipation     Mood changes, from depression to euphoria     Food cravings     Neck stiffness     Increased urination     Fluid retention     Frequent yawning                                    AuraFor some people, an aura might occur before or during migraines.
Auras are reversible symptoms of the nervous system.
They're usually visual but can also include other disturbances.
Each symptom usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and can last up to 60 minutes.
Examples of migraine auras include:      Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light     Vision loss     Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg     Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body     Difficulty speaking                                    AttackA migraine usually lasts from 4 to 72 hours if untreated.
How often migraines occur varies from person to person.
Migraines might occur rarely or strike several times a month.
During a migraine, you might have:      Pain usually on one side of your head, but often on both sides     Pain that throbs or pulses     Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch     Nausea and vomiting                                    Post-dromeAfter a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused and washed out for up to a day.
Some people report feeling elated.
Sudden head movement might bring on the pain again briefly.
When to see a doctorMigraines are often undiagnosed and untreated.
If you regularly have signs and symptoms of migraine, keep a record of your attacks and how you treated them.
Then make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your headaches.
Even if you have a history of headaches, see your doctor if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different.
See your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room if you have any of the following signs and symptoms, which could indicate a more serious medical problem:      An abrupt, severe headache like a thunderclap     Headache with fever, stiff neck, confusion, seizures, double vision, numbness or weakness in any part of the body, which could be a sign of a stroke     Headache after a head injury     A chronic headache that is worse after coughing, exertion, straining or a sudden movement     New headache pain after age 50 More InformationMigraine care at Mayo ClinicMigraines and gastrointestinal problems: Is there a link?
Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic                                                      CausesThough migraine causes aren't fully understood, genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role.
Changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway, might be involved.
So might imbalances in brain chemicals — including serotonin, which helps regulate pain in your nervous system.
Researchers are studying the role of serotonin in migraines.
Other neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).
Migraine triggersThere are a number of migraine triggers, including:           Hormonal changes in women.
Fluctuations in estrogen, such as before or during menstrual periods, pregnancy and menopause, seem to trigger headaches in many women.
Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives, also can worsen migraines.
Some women, however, find that their migraines occur less often when taking these medications.
Drinks.
These include alcohol, especially wine, and too much caffeine, such as coffee.
Stress.
Stress at work or home can cause migraines.
Sensory stimuli.
Bright or flashing lights can induce migraines, as can loud sounds.
Strong smells — such as perfume, paint thinner, secondhand smoke and others — trigger migraines in some people.
Sleep changes.
Missing sleep or getting too much sleep can trigger migraines in some people.
Physical factors.
Intense physical exertion, including sexual activity, might provoke migraines.
Weather changes.
A change of weather or barometric pressure can prompt a migraine.
Medications.
Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines.
Foods.
Aged cheeses and salty and processed foods might trigger migraines.
So might skipping meals.
Food additives.
These include the sweetener aspartame and the preservative monosodium glutamate (MSG), found in many foods.
More InformationMigraine care at Mayo ClinicMigraines: Are they triggered by weather changes?Mayo Clinic Minute Weathering migraines                                   Risk factorsSeveral factors make you more prone to having migraines, including:      Family history.
If you have a family member with migraines, then you have a good chance of developing them too.
Age.
Migraines can begin at any age, though the first often occurs during adolescence.
Migraines tend to peak during your 30s, and gradually become less severe and less frequent in the following decades.
Sex.
Women are three times more likely than men to have migraines.
Hormonal changes.
For women who have migraines, headaches might begin just before or shortly after onset of menstruation.
They might also change during pregnancy or menopause.
Migraines generally improve after menopause.
ComplicationsTaking painkillers too often can trigger serious medication-overuse headaches.
The risk seems to be highest with aspirin, acetaminophen and caffeine combinations.
Overuse headaches may also occur if you take aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) for more than 14 days a month or triptans, sumatriptan (Imitrex, Tosymra) or rizatriptan (Maxalt, Maxalt-MLT) for more than nine days a month.
Medication-overuse headaches occur when medications stop relieving pain and begin to cause headaches.
You then use more pain medication, which continues the cycle.

[1] Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days.
[1] Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell.
[2] The pain is generally made worse by physical activity,[14] although regular exercise may have prophylactic effects.
[15] Up to one-third of people affected have aura: typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur.
[14] Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following, but not everyone has this symptom.
[16] Migraine is believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors.
[3] About two-thirds of cases run in families.
[5] Changing hormone levels may also play a role, as migraine affects slightly more boys than girls before puberty and two to three times more women than men.
[4][17] The risk of migraine usually decreases during pregnancy and after menopause.
[4][18] The underlying mechanisms are not fully known.
[18] They are, however, believed to involve the nerves and blood vessels of the brain.
[5] Initial recommended treatment is with simple pain medication such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) for the headache, medication for the nausea, and the avoidance of triggers.
[10] Specific medications such as triptans or ergotamines may be used in those for whom simple pain medications are not effective.
[5] Caffeine in combination with other analgesics is safe and effective in treatment of acute migraine.
[19][20][21] A number of medications are useful to prevent attacks including metoprolol, valproate, and topiramate.
[8][9] Globally, approximately 15% of people are affected by migraine.
[11] In the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2010, it was ranked as the third most prevalent disorder in the world.
[22] It most often starts at puberty and is worst during middle age.
[1] As of 2016, it is one of the most common causes of disability.
[23] An early description consistent with migraines is contained in the Ebers papyrus, written around 1500 BC in ancient Egypt.
[24] The word migraine is from the Greek ἡμικρᾱνίᾱ (hēmikrāníā), 'pain in half of the head',[25] from ἡμι- (hēmi-), 'half', and κρᾱνίον (krāníon), 'skull'.

[5][27] About 15–30% of people living with migraine experience episodes with aura,[10][28] and they also frequently experience episodes without aura.
[29] The severity of the pain, duration of the headache, and frequency of attacks are variable.
[5] A migraine lasting longer than 72 hours is termed status migrainosus.
[30] There are four possible phases to a migraine, although not all the phases are necessarily experienced:[14]  The prodrome, which occurs hours or days before the headache The aura, which immediately precedes the headache The pain phase, also known as headache phase The postdrome, the effects experienced following the end of a migraine attack Migraine is associated with major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive–compulsive disorder.
These psychiatric disorders are approximately 2–5 times more common in people without aura, and 3–10 times more common in people with aura.
[31]  Prodrome phase[edit] Prodromal or premonitory symptoms occur in about 60% of those with migraines,[2][32] with an onset that can range from two hours to two days before the start of pain or the aura.
[33] These symptoms may include a wide variety of phenomena,[34] including altered mood, irritability, depression or euphoria, fatigue, craving for certain food(s), stiff muscles (especially in the neck), constipation or diarrhea, and sensitivity to smells or noise.
[32] This may occur in those with either migraine with aura or migraine without aura.
[35] Neuroimaging indicates the limbic system and hypothalamus as the origin of prodromal symptoms in migraine.
[36]  Aura phase[edit]           Aura is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache.
[2] Aura appears gradually over a number of minutes (usually occurring over 5–60 minutes) and generally lasts less than 60 minutes.
[37][38] Symptoms can be visual, sensory or motoric in nature, and many people experience more than one.
[39] Visual effects occur most frequently: they occur in up to 99% of cases and in more than 50% of cases are not accompanied by sensory or motor effects.
[39] Visual disturbances often consist of a scintillating scotoma (an area of partial alteration in the field of vision which flickers and may interfere with a person's ability to read or drive).
[2] These typically start near the center of vision and then spread out to the sides with zigzagging lines which have been described as looking like fortifications or walls of a castle.
[39] Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines.
[39] Some people lose part of their field of vision known as hemianopsia while others experience blurring.
[39] Sensory aura are the second most common type; they occur in 30–40% of people with auras.
[39] Often a feeling of pins-and-needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose–mouth area on the same side.
[39] Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has passed with a loss of position sense.
[39] Other symptoms of the aura phase can include speech or language disturbances, world spinning, and less commonly motor problems.
[39] Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic migraine, and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras.
[39] Auditory hallucinations or delusions have also been described.
[40]  Pain phase[edit] Classically the headache is unilateral, throbbing, and moderate to severe in intensity.
[37] It usually comes on gradually[37] and is aggravated by physical activity.
[14] However, the effects of physical activity on migraine are complex and some researchers have concluded that, while exercise can trigger migraine attacks, regular exercise may have a prophylactic effect and decrease frequency of attacks.
[15] The feeling of pulsating pain is not in phase with the pulse.
[41] In more than 40% of cases, however, the pain may be bilateral and neck pain is commonly associated with it.
[42] Bilateral pain is particularly common in those who have migraine without aura.
[2] Less commonly pain may occur primarily in the back or top of the head.
[2] The pain usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults,[37] however in young children frequently lasts less than 1 hour.
[43] The frequency of attacks is variable, from a few in a lifetime to several a week, with the average being about one a month.
[44][45] The pain is frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, sensitivity to smells, fatigue and irritability.
[2] Many thus seek a dark and quiet room.
[46] In a basilar migraine, a migraine with neurological symptoms related to the brain stem or with neurological symptoms on both sides of the body,[47] common effects include a sense of the world spinning, light-headedness, and confusion.
[2] Nausea occurs in almost 90% of people, and vomiting occurs in about one-third.
[46] Other symptoms may include blurred vision, nasal stuffiness, diarrhea, frequent urination, pallor, or sweating.
[48] Swelling or tenderness of the scalp may occur as can neck stiffness.
[48] Associated symptoms are less common in the elderly.
[49]  Silent migraine[edit] Sometimes, aura occurs without a subsequent headache.
[39] This is known in modern classification as a typical aura without headache, or acephalgic migraine in previous classification, or commonly as a silent migraine.
[50][51] However, silent migraine can still produce debilitating symptoms, with visual disturbance, vision loss in half of both eyes, alterations in color perception, and other sensory problems, like sensitivity to light, sound, and odors, and aura sudden outbreak without headache can be scary.
[52] It can last from 15 to 30 minutes, usually no longer than 60 minutes, and it can recur or appear as an isolated event.
[51]  Postdrome[edit] The migraine postdrome could be defined as that constellation of symptoms occurring once the acute headache has settled.
[53] Many report a sore feeling in the area where the migraine was, and some report impaired thinking for a few days after the headache has passed.
The person may feel tired or "hung over" and have head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes, and weakness.
[54] According to one summary, "Some people feel unusually refreshed or euphoric after an attack, whereas others note depression and malaise.
"[55] For some individuals this can vary each time.
Cause[edit] The underlying causes of migraines are unknown.
[56] However, they are believed to be related to a mix of environmental and genetic factors.
[3] They run in families in about two-thirds of cases[5] and rarely occur due to a single gene defect.
[57] While migraines were once believed to be more common in those of high intelligence, this does not appear to be true.
[58] A number of psychological conditions are associated, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder,[59] as are many biological events or triggers.
Genetics[edit] Main article: Genetics of migraine headaches Studies of twins indicate a 34% to 51% genetic influence of likelihood to develop migraine.
[3] This genetic relationship is stronger for migraine with aura than for migraines without aura.
[29] A number of specific variants of genes increase the risk by a small to moderate amount.
[57] Single gene disorders that result in migraines are rare.
[57] One of these is known as familial hemiplegic migraine, a type of migraine with aura, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
[60][61] Four genes have been shown to be involved in familial hemiplegic migraine.
[62] Three of these genes are involved in ion transport.
[62] The fourth is an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex.
[62] Another genetic disorder associated with migraine is CADASIL syndrome or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
[2] One meta-analysis found a protective effect from an angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphisms on migraine.
[63] The TRPM8 gene, which codes for a cation channel, has been linked to migraines.
[64]  Triggers[edit] Migraine may be induced by triggers, with some reporting it as an influence in a minority of cases[5] and others the majority.
[65] Many things such as fatigue, certain foods, and weather have been labeled as triggers; however, the strength and significance of these relationships are uncertain.
[65][66] Most people with migraines report experiencing triggers.
[67] Symptoms may start up to 24 hours after a trigger.
[5]  Physiological aspects[edit] Common triggers quoted are stress, hunger, and fatigue (these equally contribute to tension headaches).
[65] Psychological stress has been reported as a factor by 50 to 80% of people.
[68] Migraine has also been associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and abuse.
[69] Migraine episodes are more likely to occur around menstruation.
[68] Other hormonal influences, such as menarche, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause, also play a role.
[70] These hormonal influences seem to play a greater role in migraine without aura.
[58] Migraine episodes typically do not occur during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, or following menopause.
[2]  Dietary aspects[edit] Between 12 and 60% of people report foods as triggers.
[71][72] Evidence for such triggers, however, mostly relies on self-reports and is not rigorous enough to prove or disprove any particular trigger.
[73] A clear explanation for why food might trigger migraines is also lacking.
[71] There does not appear to be evidence for an effect of tyramine – which is naturally present in chocolate, alcoholic beverages, most cheeses and processed meats – on migraine.
[74] Likewise, while monosodium glutamate (MSG) is frequently reported,[75] evidence does not consistently support that it is a dietary trigger.
[76]  Environmental aspects[edit] A review on potential triggers in the indoor and outdoor environment concluded that there is insufficient evidence to confirm environmental factors as causing migraine.
They nevertheless suggested that people living with migraine take some preventive measures related to indoor air quality and lighting.
This includes ventilation and various black out items to reduce light at the maximum rate.
[77]  Pathophysiology[edit]   Animation of cortical spreading depression Migraine is believed to be primarily a neurological disorder,[78][79][80] while others believe it to be a neurovascular disorder with blood vessels playing the key role, although current evidence does not support this completely.
[81][82][83][84] Others believe both are likely important.
[85][86][87][88] One theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem.
[89]  Aura[edit] Cortical spreading depression, or spreading depression according to Leão, is a burst of neuronal activity followed by a period of inactivity, which is seen in those with migraines with aura.
[90] There are a number of explanations for its occurrence, including activation of NMDA receptors leading to calcium entering the cell.
[90] After the burst of activity, the blood flow to the cerebral cortex in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours.
[90] It is believed that when depolarization travels down the underside of the brain, nerves that sense pain in the head and neck are triggered.
[90]  Pain[edit] The exact mechanism of the head pain which occurs during a migraine episode is unknown.
[91] Some evidence supports a primary role for central nervous system structures (such as the brainstem and diencephalon),[92] while other data support the role of peripheral activation (such as via the sensory nerves that surround blood vessels of the head and neck).
[91] The potential candidate vessels include dural arteries, pial arteries and extracranial arteries such as those of the scalp.
[91] The role of vasodilatation of the extracranial arteries, in particular, is believed to be significant.
[93]  Neuromodulators[edit] Adenosine, a neuromodulator, may be involved.
[94] Released after the progressive cleavage of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine acts on adenosine receptors to put the body and brain in a low activity state by dilating blood vessels and slowing the heart rate, such as before and during the early stages of sleep.
Adenosine levels have been found to be high during migraine attacks.
[94][95] Caffeine's role as an inhibitor of adenosine may explain its effect in reducing migraine.
[96] Low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), are also believed to be involved.
[97] Calcitonin gene related peptides (CGRPs) have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine, as levels of it become elevated during an attack.
[10][41]  Diagnosis[edit] The diagnosis of a migraine is based on signs and symptoms.
[5] Neuroimaging tests are not necessary to diagnose migraine, but may be used to find other causes of headaches in those whose examination and history do not confirm a migraine diagnosis.
[98] It is believed that a substantial number of people with the condition remain undiagnosed.
[5] The diagnosis of migraine without aura, according to the International Headache Society, can be made according to the following criteria, the "5, 4, 3, 2, 1 criteria":[14]  Five or more attacks—for migraine with aura, two attacks are sufficient for diagnosis.
Four hours to three days in duration Two or more of the following: Unilateral (affecting one side of the head) Pulsating Moderate or severe pain intensity Worsened by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity One or more of the following: Nausea and/or vomiting; Sensitivity to both light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia) If someone experiences two of the following: photophobia, nausea, or inability to work or study for a day, the diagnosis is more likely.
[99] In those with four out of five of the following: pulsating headache, duration of 4–72 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person's life, the probability that this is a migraine is 92%.
[10] In those with fewer than three of these symptoms the probability is 17%.
[10]  Classification[edit] Main article: ICHD classification and diagnosis of migraine Migraine was first comprehensively classified in 1988.
[29] The International Headache Society updated their classification of headaches in 2004.
[14] A third version was published in 2018.
[100] According to this classification, migraine is a primary headache disorder along with tension-type headaches and cluster headaches, among others.
[101] Migraine is divided into seven subclasses (some of which include further subdivisions):  Migraine without aura, or "common migraine", involves migraine headaches that are not accompanied by aura.
Migraine with aura, or "classic migraine", usually involves migraine headaches accompanied by aura.
Less commonly, aura can occur without a headache, or with a nonmigraine headache.
Two other varieties are familial hemiplegic migraine and sporadic hemiplegic migraine, in which a person has migraine with aura and with accompanying motor weakness.
If a close relative has had the same condition, it is called "familial", otherwise it is called "sporadic".
Another variety is basilar-type migraine, where a headache and aura are accompanied by difficulty speaking, world spinning, ringing in ears, or a number of other brainstem-related symptoms, but not motor weakness.
This type was initially believed to be due to spasms of the basilar artery, the artery that supplies the brainstem.
Now that this mechanism is not believed to be primary, the symptomatic term migraine with brainstem aura (MBA) is preferred.
[47] Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine include cyclical vomiting (occasional intense periods of vomiting), abdominal migraine (abdominal pain, usually accompanied by nausea), and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (occasional attacks of vertigo).
Retinal migraine involves migraine headaches accompanied by visual disturbances or even temporary blindness in one eye.
Complications of migraine describe migraine headaches and/or auras that are unusually long or unusually frequent, or associated with a seizure or brain lesion.
Probable migraine describes conditions that have some characteristics of migraines, but where there is not enough evidence to diagnose it as a migraine with certainty (in the presence of concurrent medication overuse).
Chronic migraine is a complication of migraines, and is a headache that fulfills diagnostic criteria for migraine headache and occurs for a greater time interval.
Specifically, greater or equal to 15 days/month for longer than 3 months.
[102] Abdominal migraine[edit] The diagnosis of abdominal migraine is controversial.
[103] Some evidence indicates that recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the absence of a headache may be a type of migraine[103][104] or are at least a precursor to migraines.
[29] These episodes of pain may or may not follow a migraine-like prodrome and typically last minutes to hours.
[103] They often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical migraine.
[103] Other syndromes that are believed to be precursors include cyclical vomiting syndrome and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood.
[29]  Differential diagnosis[edit] Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to a migraine headache include temporal arteritis, cluster headaches, acute glaucoma, meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
[10] Temporal arteritis typically occurs in people over 50 years old and presents with tenderness over the temple, cluster headache presents with one-sided nose stuffiness, tears and severe pain around the orbits, acute glaucoma is associated with vision problems, meningitis with fevers, and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a very fast onset.
[10] Tension headaches typically occur on both sides, are not pounding, and are less disabling.
[10] Those with stable headaches that meet criteria for migraines should not receive neuroimaging to look for other intracranial disease.
[105][106][107] This requires that other concerning findings such as papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) are not present.
People with migraines are not at an increased risk of having another cause for severe headaches.
Prevention[edit] Main article: Prevention of migraines Preventive treatments of migraine include medications, nutritional supplements, lifestyle alterations, and surgery.
Prevention is recommended in those who have headaches more than two days a week, cannot tolerate the medications used to treat acute attacks, or those with severe attacks that are not easily controlled.
[10] Recommended lifestyle changes include stopping tobacco use and reducing behaviors that interfere with sleep.
[108] The goal is to reduce the frequency, painfulness, and duration of migraine episodes, and to increase the effectiveness of abortive therapy.
[109] Another reason for prevention is to avoid medication overuse headache.
This is a common problem and can result in chronic daily headache.
[110][111]  Medication[edit] Preventive migraine medications are considered effective if they reduce the frequency or severity of the migraine attacks by at least 50%.
[112] Due to few medications being approved specifically for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches; many medications such as beta-blockers, anticonvulsive agents such as topiramate or sodium valproate, antidepressants such as amitriptyline and calcium channel blockers such as flunarizine are used off label for the preventative treatment of migraine headaches.
[38] Guidelines are fairly consistent in rating the anticonvulsants topiramate and divalproex/sodium valproate, and the beta blockers propranolol and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence for first-line use for migraine prophylaxis in adults.
[113][114] Propranolol and topiramate have the best evidence in children; however, evidence only supports short-term benefit as of 2020.
[108][115] The beta blocker Timolol is also effective for migraine prevention and in reducing migraine attack frequency and severity.
[113] While beta blockers are often used for first-line treatment, other antihypertensives also have a proven efficiency in migraine prevention, namely the calcium channel blocker Verapamil[116] and the angiotensin receptor blocker Candesartan.
[117][118] Tentative evidence also supports the use of magnesium supplementation.
[119] Increasing dietary intake may be better.
[120] Recommendations regarding effectiveness varied for the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin.
Frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine.
[113] The antidepressants Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are probably also effective.
[121] Angiotensin inhibition by either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist may reduce attacks.
[122] Medications in the anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide, including eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, appear to decrease the frequency of migraines by one to two per month.
[123] They are, however, expensive: a year of erenumab costs $6,900 as of 2019.
[124]  Alternative therapies[edit] Acupuncture has a small effect in reducing migraine frequency, compared to sham acupuncture, a practice where needles are placed randomly or do not penetrate the skin.
[125] Physiotherapy, massage and relaxation, and chiropractic manipulation might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches; however, the research had some problems with methodology.
[126][127] Another review, however, found evidence to support spinal manipulation to be poor and insufficient to support its use.
[128] Tentative evidence supports the use of stress reduction techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and relaxation techniques.
[68] Regular physical exercise may decrease the frequency.
[15] Numerous psychological approaches have been developed that are aimed at preventing or reducing the frequency of migraine in adults including educational approaches, relaxation techniques, assistance in developing coping strategies, strategies to change the way one thinks of a migraine, and strategies to reduce the symptoms of a migraine.
[129] The medical evidence supporting the effectiveness of these types of psychological approaches is very limited.
[129] Among alternative medicines, butterbur has the best evidence for its use.
[130][131] However, unprocessed butterbur contains chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) which can cause liver damage, however there are versions that are PA free.
[132] In addition, butterbur may cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to plants such as ragweed.
[133] There is tentative evidence that coenzyme Q10 reduces migraine frequency.
[134] Feverfew has traditionally been used as a treatment for fever, headache and migraine, women’s conditions such as difficulties in labour and regulation of menstruation, relief of stomach ache, toothache and insect bites.
During the last decades, it has mainly been used for headache and as a preventive treatment for migraine.
[135] The plant parts used for medicinal use are the dried leaves or the dried aerial parts.
Several historical data supports feverfew’s traditional medicinal uses.
[136] In addition, several clinical studies have been performed assessing the efficacy and safety of feverfew monotherapy in the prevention of migraine.
[137] The majority of the clinical trials favoured feverfew over placebo.
The data also suggest that feverfew is associated with only mild and transient adverse effects.
The frequency of migraine was positively affected after treatment with feverfew.
Reduction of migraine severity was also reported after intake of feverfew and incidence of nausea and vomiting decreased significantly.
No effect of feverfew was reported in one study.
[137] There is tentative evidence for melatonin as an add-on therapy for prevention and treatment of migraine.
[138][139] The data on melatonin are mixed and certain studies have had negative results.
[138] The reasons for the mixed findings are unclear but may stem from differences in study design and dosage.
[138] Melatonin's possible mechanisms of action in migraine are not completely clear, but may include improved sleep, direct action on melatonin receptors in the brain, and anti-inflammatory properties.
[138][140]  Devices and surgery[edit] Medical devices, such as biofeedback and neurostimulators, have some advantages in migraine prevention, mainly when common anti-migraine medications are contraindicated or in case of medication overuse.
Biofeedback helps people be conscious of some physiological parameters so as to control them and try to relax and may be efficient for migraine treatment.
[141][142] Neurostimulation uses noninvasive or implantable neurostimulators similar to pacemakers for the treatment of intractable chronic migraine with encouraging results for severe cases.
[143][144] A transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator and a transcranial magnetic stimulator are approved in the United States for the prevention of migraines.
[145][146] There is also tentative evidence for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation decreases the frequency of migraines.
[147] Migraine surgery, which involves decompression of certain nerves around the head and neck, may be an option in certain people who do not improve with medications.
[148]  Management[edit] Main article: Migraine treatment There are three main aspects of treatment: trigger avoidance, acute symptomatic control, and medication for prevention.
[5] Medications are more effective if used earlier in an attack.
[5] The frequent use of medications may result in medication overuse headache, in which the headaches become more severe and more frequent.
[14] This may occur with triptans, ergotamines, and analgesics, especially opioid analgesics.
[14] Due to these concerns simple analgesics are recommended to be used less than three days per week at most.
[149]  Analgesics[edit] Recommended initial treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms are simple analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or the combination of paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), aspirin, and caffeine.
[10] Several NSAIDs, including diclofenac and ibuprofen have evidence to support their use.
[150][151] Aspirin can relieve moderate to severe migraine pain, with an effectiveness similar to sumatriptan.
[152] Ketorolac is available in intravenous and intramuscular formulations.
[10] Paracetamol, either alone or in combination with metoclopramide, is another effective treatment with a low risk of adverse effects.
[153] Intravenous metoclopramide is also effective by itself.
[154][155] In pregnancy, paracetamol and metoclopramide are deemed safe as are NSAIDs until the third trimester.
[10] Naproxen by itself may not be effective as a stand-alone medicine to stop a migraine headache as it is only weakly better than a placebo medication in clinical trials.
[156]  Antiemetics[edit] Triptans[edit] Triptans such as sumatriptan are medications used to stop an active migraine headache (an abortive medication).
Triptans are the initially recommended treatments for those with moderate to severe pain from an acute migraine headache or those with milder symptoms who do not respond to simple analgesics.
[10] Triptans have been shown to be effective for both pain and nausea in up to 75% of people.
[157][158]  There are different methods or routes of administration to take sumatriptan including oral (by mouth), injectable (subcutaneous), rectal, nasal spray, and oral dissolving tablets.
[5][159][160][161] For people with migraine symptoms such as nausea or vomitting, taking the abortive medicine by mouth or through the nose may be difficult.
All route of administration have been shown to be effective at reducing migraine symptoms, however, nasal and injectable subcutaneous administration may result in more side effects.
[161][160] The adverse effects associated with rectal administration have not been well studied.
[159] Some people may find that they respond to one type of sumatripton better than another.
[10] Most side effects are mild, including flushing; however, rare cases of myocardial ischemia have occurred.
[5] They are thus not recommended for people with cardiovascular disease,[10] who have had a stroke, or have migraines that are accompanied by neurological problems.
[162] In addition, triptans should be prescribed with caution for those with risk factors for vascular disease.
[162] While historically not recommended in those with basilar migraines there is no specific evidence of harm from their use in this population to support this caution.
[47] Triptans are not addictive, but may cause medication-overuse headaches if used more than 10 days per month.
[163] Sumatriptan does not prevent other migraine headaches from starting in the future.
[160] For increased effectiveness at stopping migraine symptoms, a combined therapy that includes sumatriptan and naproxen may be suggested.
[164]  CGRP receptor antagonists[edit] CGRP receptor antagonists target calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor to prevent migraine headaches or reduce their severity.
[38] CGRP is a signaling molecule as well as a potent vasodilator that is involved in the development of a migraine headache.
[38] There are four injectable monoclonal antibodies that target CGRP or it's receptor (eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) and the medications have demonstrated efficacy in the preventative treatment of episodic and chronic migraine headaches in phase 3 randomized clinical trials.
[38] Eptinezumab is available as an infusion every three months, Erenumab and galcanezumab are once monthly injections and fremanezumab is a monthly or quarterly injection.
Ergotamines[edit] Ergotamine and dihydroergotamine are older medications still prescribed for migraines, the latter in nasal spray and injectable forms.
[5][165] They appear equally effective to the triptans[166] and experience adverse effects that typically are benign.
[167] In the most severe cases, such as those with status migrainosus, they appear to be the most effective treatment option.
[167] They can cause vasospasm including coronary vasospasm and are contraindicated in people with coronary artery disease.
[168]  Magnesium[edit] Magnesium is recognized as an inexpensive, over-the-counter supplement which some studies have shown to be effective in both preventing and treating migraine in intravenous form.
[169]  Other[edit] Intravenous metoclopramide, intravenous prochlorperazine, or intranasal lidocaine are other potential options.
[10][155] Metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are the recommended treatment for those who present to the emergency department.
[10][155] Haloperidol may also be useful in this group.
[155][165] A single dose of intravenous dexamethasone, when added to standard treatment of a migraine attack, is associated with a 26% decrease in headache recurrence in the following 72 hours.
[170] Spinal manipulation for treating an ongoing migraine headache is not supported by evidence.
[128] It is recommended that opioids and barbiturates not be used due to questionable efficacy, addictive potential, and the risk of rebound headache.
[10][38] There is tentative evidence that propofol may be useful if other measures are not effective.
[171] Occipital nerve stimulation, may be effective but has the downsides of being cost-expensive and has a significant amount of complications.
[172] There is modest evidence for the effectiveness of non-invasive neuromodulatory devices, behavioral therapies and acupuncture in the treatment of migraine headaches.
[38] There is little to no evidence for the effectiveness of physical therapy, chiropractic manipulation and dietary approaches to the treatment of migraine headaches.
[38] Behavioral treatment of migraine headaches may be helpful for those who may not be able to take medications (for example pregnant women).
[38] Feverfew is registered as a traditional herbal medicine in the Nordic countries under the brand name Glitinum, only powdered feverfew is approved in the Herbal community monograph issued by European Medicines Agency (EMA).
Sexual activity, particularly orgasm, may provide relief for some migraineurs.
[173]  Children[edit] Ibuprofen helps decrease pain in children with migraines and is the initially recommended treatment.
[174][175] Paracetamol does not appear to be effective in providing pain relief.
[174] Triptans are effective, though there is a risk of causing minor side effects like taste disturbance, nasal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, low energy, nausea, or vomiting.
[174][176] Ibuprofen should be used less than half the days in a month and triptans less than a third of the days in a month to decrease the risk of medication overuse headache.
[175]  Chronic migraine[edit] Topiramate and botulinum toxin (Botox) have evidence in treating chronic migraine.
[121][177] Botulinum toxin has been found to be useful in those with chronic migraine but not those with episodic ones.
[178][179] The anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody erenumab was found in one study to decrease chronic migraines by 2.4 days more than placebo.
[180]  Prognosis[edit] "Migraine exists on a continuum of different attack frequencies and associated levels of disability.
"[181] For those with occasional, episodic migraine, a "proper combination of drugs for prevention and treatment of migraine attacks" can limit the disease's impact on patients' personal and professional lives.
[182]  But fewer than half of people with migraine seek medical care and more than half go undiagnosed and undertreated.
[183] "Responsive prevention and treatment of migraine is incredibly important" because evidence shows "an increased sensitivity after each successive attack, eventually leading to chronic daily migraine in some individuals.
"[182] Repeated migraine results in "reorganization of brain circuitry," causing "profound functional as well as structural changes in the brain.
"[184] "One of the most important problems in clinical migraine is the progression from an intermittent, self-limited inconvenience to a life-changing disorder of chronic pain, sensory amplification, and autonomic and affective disruption.
This progression, sometimes termed chronification in the migraine literature, is common, affecting 3% of migraineurs in a given year, such that 8% of migraineurs have chronic migraine in any given year."
Brain imagery reveals that the electrophysiological changes seen during an attack become permanent in people with chronic migraine; "thus, from an electrophysiological point of view, chronic migraine indeed resembles a never-ending migraine attack.
"[184] Severe migraine ranks in the highest category of disability, according to the World Health Organization, which uses objective metrics to determine disability burden for the authoritative annual Global Burden of Disease report.
The report classifies severe migraine alongside severe depression, active psychosis, quadriplegia, and terminal-stage cancer.
[185] Migraine with aura appears to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke[186] doubling the risk.
[187] Being a young adult, being female, using hormonal birth control, and smoking further increases this risk.
[186] There also appears to be an association with cervical artery dissection.
[188] Migraine without aura does not appear to be a factor.
[189] The relationship with heart problems is inconclusive with a single study supporting an association.
[186] Migraine does not appear to increase the risk of death from stroke or heart disease.
[190] Preventative therapy of migraines in those with migraine with aura may prevent associated strokes.
[191] People with migraine, particularly women, may develop higher than average numbers of white matter brain lesions of unclear significance.

[11] It is more common in women at 19% than men at 11%.
[11] In the United States, about 6% of men and 18% of women experience a migraine attack in a given year, with a lifetime risk of about 18% and 43% respectively.
[5] In Europe, migraines affect 12–28% of people at some point in their lives with about 6–15% of adult men and 14–35% of adult women getting at least one yearly.
[17] Rates of migraine are slightly lower in Asia and Africa than in Western countries.
[58][193] Chronic migraine occurs in approximately 1.4 to 2.2% of the population.
[194] These figures vary substantially with age: onset of migraine is most commonly between 15 and 24 years of age, and occur most frequently in those 35 to 45 years of age.
[5] In children, about 1.7% of 7 year olds and 3.9% of those between 7 and 15 experience migraine, with the condition being slightly more common in boys before puberty.
[195] Children as young as two years may be affected.
[174] During adolescence, migraine becomes more common among women[195] and this persists for the rest of the lifespan, being twice as common among elderly females than males.
[196] In women migraine without aura are more common than migraine with aura; however in men the two types occur with similar frequency.
[58] During perimenopause symptoms often get worse before decreasing in severity.
[196] While symptoms resolve in about two thirds of the elderly, in 3 to 10% they persist.
[49]  History[edit]   The Head Ache, George Cruikshank (1819) An early description consistent with migraine is contained in the Ebers papyrus, written around 1500 BCE in ancient Egypt.
[24] In 200 BCE, writings from the Hippocratic school of medicine described the visual aura that can precede the headache and a partial relief occurring through vomiting.
[197] A second-century description by Aretaeus of Cappadocia divided headaches into three types: cephalalgia, cephalea, and heterocrania.
[198] Galen of Pergamon used the term hemicrania (half-head), from which the word migraine was eventually derived.
[198] He also proposed that the pain arose from the meninges and blood vessels of the head.
[197] Migraine was first divided into the two now used types – migraine with aura (migraine ophthalmique) and migraine without aura (migraine vulgaire) in 1887 by Louis Hyacinthe Thomas, a French Librarian.
[197] The mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen, which she described as “reflections of the living light", are consistent with the visual aura experienced during migraines.
[199]    A trepanated skull, from the Neolithic.
The perimeter of the hole in the skull is rounded off by ingrowth of new bony tissue, indicating that the person survived the operation.
Trepanation, the deliberate drilling of holes into a skull, was practiced as early as 7,000 BCE.
[24] While sometimes people survived, many would have died from the procedure due to infection.
[200] It was believed to work via "letting evil spirits escape".
[201] William Harvey recommended trepanation as a treatment for migraines in the 17th century.
[202] While many treatments for migraine have been attempted, it was not until 1868 that use of a substance which eventually turned out to be effective began.
[197] This substance was the fungus ergot from which ergotamine was isolated in 1918.
[203] Methysergide was developed in 1959 and the first triptan, sumatriptan, was developed in 1988.
[203] During the 20th century with better study-design, effective preventive measures were found and confirmed.
[197]  Society and culture[edit] Migraine is a significant source of both medical costs and lost productivity.
It has been estimated that migraine is the most costly neurological disorder in the European Community, costing more than €27 billion per year.
[204] In the United States, direct costs have been estimated at $17 billion, while indirect costs — such as missed or decreased ability to work — is estimated at $15 billion.
[205] Nearly a tenth of the direct cost is due to the cost of triptans.
[205] In those who do attend work with a migraine, effectiveness is decreased by around a third.
[204] Negative impacts also frequently occur for a person's family.
[204]  Research[edit] Potential prevention mechanisms[edit] Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows promise[10][206] as does transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation.
[207] There is preliminary evidence that a ketogenic diet may help prevent episodic and long-term migraine.
[208][209]  Potential gender dependency[edit] While no definitive proof has been found linking migraine to gender, statistical data indicates that women may be more prone to suffer from migraine, showing migraine incidence three times higher among women than men.
[210][211] The Society for Women’s Health Research has also mentioned hormonal influences, mainly estrogen, as having a considerable role in provoking migraine pain.
Studies and research related to the gender dependencies of migraine are still ongoing, and conclusions have yet to be achieved.

The main symptom of a migraine is usually an intense headache on 1 side of the head.
The pain is usually a moderate or severe throbbing sensation that gets worse when you move and prevents you carrying out normal activities.
In some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck.
Additional symptoms Other symptoms commonly associated with a migraine include:  feeling sick  being sick  increased sensitivity to light and sound, which is why many people with a migraine want to rest in a quiet, dark room   Some people also occasionally experience other symptoms, including:  sweating  poor concentration,  feeling very hot or very cold  tummy (abdominal) pain diarrhoea  Not everyone with a migraine experiences these additional symptoms and some people may experience them without having a headache.
The symptoms of a migraine usually last between 4 hours and 3 days, although you may feel very tired for up to a week afterwards.
Symptoms of aura About 1 in 3 people with migraines have temporary warning symptoms, known as aura, before a migraine.
These include:  visual problems – such as seeing flashing lights, zig-zag patterns or blind spots  numbness or a tingling sensation like pins and needles – which usually starts in 1 hand and moves up your arm before affecting your face, lips and tongue  feeling dizzy or off balance  difficulty speaking  loss of consciousness – although this is unusual   Aura symptoms typically develop over the course of about 5 minutes and last for up to an hour.
Some people may experience aura followed by only a mild headache or no headache at all.
When to get medical advice You should see a GP if you have frequent or severe migraine symptoms that cannot be managed with occasional use of over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol.
Try not to use the maximum dosage of painkillers on a regular or frequent basis as this could make it harder to treat headaches over time.
You should also make an appointment to see a GP if you have frequent migraines (on more than 5 days a month), even if they can be controlled with medicine, as you may benefit from preventative treatment.
You should call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you or someone you're with experiences:  paralysis or weakness in 1 or both arms or 1 side of the face  slurred or garbled speech  a sudden agonising headache resulting in a severe pain unlike anything experienced before  headache along with a high temperature (fever), stiff neck, mental confusion, seizures, double vision and a rash   These symptoms may be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a stroke or meningitis, and should be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible.
Find out more about diagnosing migraines Stages of a migraine Migraines often develop in distinct stages, although not everyone goes through all of these:  prodromal (pre-headache) stage – changes in mood, energy levels, behaviour and appetite that can occur several hours or days before an attack  aura – usually visual problems, such as flashes of light or blind spots, which can last for 5 minutes to an hour  headache stage – usually a pulsating or throbbing pain on 1 side of the head, often accompanied by feeling sick, vomiting or extreme sensitivity to bright light and loud sounds, which can last for 4 to 72 hours  resolution stage – when the headache and other symptoms gradually fade away, although you may feel tired for a few days afterwards                                       Page last reviewed: 10 May 2019     Next review due: 10 May 2022                                    Previous         :         Migraine                                                                    Next         :         Causes What are migraine symptoms?A migraine isn’t just an average headache.
Migraines are strong, pounding headaches typically on one side of the head.Migraines usually include several other symptoms.
They’re sometimes preceded by warning symptoms called aura.
These symptoms may include flashes of light, visual “floaters,” or tingling sensations in your arms and legs.Migraine episodes, which can last for hours or days, can greatly affect your life.
According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,Trusted Source migraines are experienced by 12 percent of the U.S. adult population.
Many of these migraines are caused by the activation of nerve fibers in the blood vessels of the brain.The classic migraine evolves through four separate stage.
Each stage has different symptoms.
These stages include:the prodrome (premonitory) stagethe aura (visual symptoms or tingling)the headache (main attack) stagethe postdrome (recovery) stageNot all people who get migraines experience all of the stages.
Prodrome stageThe premonitory or prodrome stage can start anywhere from one hour to two days before your migraine begins.
Symptoms that may indicate that a migraine is coming on include:fatiguemood changes, such as anxiety or depressionthirstcraving for sugary foodstight or sore neckconstipationirritabilityfrequent yawning Aura stageThe aura stage happens right before or during a migraine.
Auras are usually visual disturbances, but can involve other sensations.
Symptoms build up gradually and last for about 20 to 60 minutes.
About 30 percent of people who experience migraine have migraine with aura.Symptoms of an aura can include:seeing bright spots or flashes of light vision loss or seeing dark spotstingling sensations in an arm or leg described as “pins and needles”speech problems or inability to speak (aphasia)ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Main attack stageThe attack stage includes the headache and other symptoms.
It can last for a few hours to a few days.During an attack, you might experience the following symptoms:pulsating or throbbing pain on one or both sides of the headextreme sensitivity to light, sounds, or smellsworsening pain during physical activitynausea and vomitingabdominal pain or heartburnloss of appetitelightheadednessblurred visionfaintingIf you have a migraine, you’ll often feel the need to lie down in the dark and quiet to escape from light, sounds, and movement.
This is one of the main differences between migraines and other types of headaches.
Fortunately, you may find that sleeping for an hour or two can help end an attack.
Recovery stageDuring the recovery (postdrome) stage, you may feel tired and drained.
The migraine fades slowly.
Some people report feelings of euphoria.
Migraines vs. tension headachesTension headaches and migraines may cause very similar symptoms.
Migraine symptoms tend to be more severe than tension headaches.With a tension headache, your pain is usually mild to moderate throughout your head, and disappears within a few hours.
Migraines tend to last longer and are often debilitating.Tension headaches don’t typically cause any visual side effects like aura or physical side effects like nausea or vomiting.
Tension headaches can make you feel sensitive to light or sound but usually not both.
Sinus headaches are often confused for migraines because they share many symptoms, including pressure in the sinuses and watery eyes.
Sinus headaches are usually only moderately painful and can be treated with sinus treatments or other allergy medications.
Migraines vs. cluster headachesCluster headaches differ from migraines mainly in that they follow patterns of occurrence.
They “cluster” together in short, episodic attacks during a period of weeks or months.
Sometimes, an entire year can pass between two headache clusters.
Migraines tend not to follow this kind of pattern.Symptoms of migraines and cluster headaches are similar.
In both cases, pain is severe.
Cluster headaches can cause many distinct symptoms that migraines don’t cause, including:red, bloodshot eyesswelling of the eyelids (edema)shrinking of the pupil (miosis)runny nose or congestion drooping of the eyelids (ptosis)agitation, annoyance, or restlessness during a headache If you observe any of these symptoms during a severe headache, you’re likely experiencing a cluster headache, not a migraine.
Your doctor can usually diagnose cluster headaches by examining the nerves in your eye or discovering an abnormality during MRI scans linked to cluster headaches.
Talk to your doctor about getting checked for cluster headaches if you have these symptoms.
Relief and treatmentMedications for pain relief may be enough to treat your symptoms.
Common pain relievers that can help migraine symptoms include:ibuprofenaspirinacetaminophen (Tylenol)Excedrin (aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine)If your pain continues, talk to your doctor about other treatment options.
Migraine preventionIf you have at least six migraines per month or three migraines a month that severely interfere with your daily life, your doctor may recommend preventive medications that are effective against migraine symptoms, including:beta-blockers, such as propranolol or timolol, for high blood pressure or coronary diseasescalcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, for high blood pressuretricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, for controlling serotonin and other chemicals in your brainantiseizure drugs, such as valproate (in moderate doses)pain relievers, such as naproxenCGRP antagonists, a new class of drugs approved to prevent migrainesThere can be side effects of these medications.
Also, talk to your doctor about lifestyle changes that can help decrease migraines.
Things like quitting smoking, getting plenty of sleep, avoiding triggers from certain foods, and staying hydrated can be useful.
Some alternative medicines are often used to aid in relieving migraine symptoms, including:acupuncturecognitive behavioral therapy, a type of therapy that instructs you on how your behavior and thinking can change the way you perceive your migraine painherbs, such as feverfewriboflavin (B-2) magnesium supplements (if you have low levels of magnesium in your body)Your doctor may recommend that you try these alternative options if medicinal treatments aren’t working for you or if you want to take greater control of preventive care for your migraines.
Migraines in children and teensAround 10 percent of children and teens experience migraines.
Symptoms are generally similar to migraines in adults.
Teens are also more likely to have chronic migraine (CM), which causes migraines for several hours a day for over 15 days of the month across three or more months.
CM may cause your child to miss school or social activities.Migraines can be passed on genetically.
If you or your child’s other biological parent has a history of migraines, your child has a 50 percent chance of having them.
If both you and the other parent have a migraine history, your child has a 75 percent chance.
Plus, many things can trigger your child’s migraines, including:stresscaffeinemedications, including birth control and asthma treatmentroutine changesFind out what’s causing your child’s migraine, then talk to your doctor about the best way to treat and prevent migraines.
In addition to medications, your doctor may recommend relaxation techniques and preventive therapy so that your child can better understand and manage their migraines.
OutlookMigraine pain can be severe, and often unbearable.
Depression is more likely to occur in those who experience migraines than those who do not.

Here’s our process.Migraine is a medical condition that involves severe, recurring headaches and other symptoms.
A migraine episode is a type of headache.
An episode usually occurs in stages and can last for several days.
Severe cases can affect a person’s daily life, including their ability to work or study.Migraine can affect people in different ways, and the triggers, severity, symptoms, and frequency can vary.
Some people have more than one episode each week, while others have them only occasionally.In 2018, researchers found that more than 15%Trusted Source of adults in the United States had experienced a migraine episode or a severe headache within the last 3 months.
Research from 2015 found that migraine affects just over 19%Trusted Source of females and 9% of males.
Episodes often occur in people aged 18–44 years, but they can happen at any time, including during childhood.SymptomsShare on PinterestEujarim Photography/Getty ImagesSymptoms of migraine tend to occur in stages:Before the headache: According to research from 2008, 20–60%Trusted Source of people with migraine experience symptoms that start hours or days before the headache.
At this stage, a person might experience a “prodrome,” which may involve emotional changes, specifically depression and irritability.
A prodrome can also include yawning, dizziness, thirst, frequent urination, and sensitivity to light and sound.
Sometimes an aura can occur.
This involves physical or sensory symptoms, such as flashing lights in the field of vision.
During the headache: Alongside a mild to severe, throbbing or pulsing headache, symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, neck pain, dizziness, and nasal congestion.
Resolution: After the headache, tiredness and irritability may last another 2 days.
This is sometimes called the “migraine hangover.” Other common features of migraine are:head pain that worsens during physical activity or strainingan inability to perform regular activities due to the painincreased sensitivity to light and sound that can sometimes be relived by lying quietly in a darkened room Other symptoms may include sweating, feeling unusually hot or cold, a stomachache, and diarrhea.Find out what else can cause a headache, nausea, and fatigue here.Migraine vs. headacheA migraine episode is different from a typical headache.
The experience is different, and they can have different causes.Writing down the symptoms and when they occur can help a person and their healthcare professional identify migraine episodes.
Keep this journal for at least 8 weeks, and note down:the time that symptoms startpossible triggers, such as stress or menstruationthe nature of the headacheany other symptomshow long the symptoms lastany noticeable indicators of migraine, such as an auraany medications and their effectsLearn more about the differences between migraine and a headache here.Causes and triggersExperts think that migraine episodes may stem from changes in the brain that affect the: way nerves communicatebalance of chemicals blood vesselsGenetic features may also play a role — having a family historyTrusted Source of migraine is a common risk factor.Migraine triggers vary from person to person.
They commonly include:hormonal changes, such as those related to menstruationemotional triggers, such as stress, depression, anxiety, and excitementdietary factors, including alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, nuts, cheese, citrus fruits, and foods containing the additives tyramine and monosodium glutamate (MSG)medications, such as sleeping pills, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and some birth control pillsenvironmental factors, including flickering screens, strong smells, secondhand smoke, loud noises, humidity, stuffy rooms, temperature changes, and bright lightsSome other possible triggers include:tirednessa lack of sleepshoulder and neck tensionpoor posturephysical overexertionlow blood sugarjet lagirregular mealtimesdehydrationAvoiding triggers, when possible, may help reduce the frequency of migraine episodes.What causes headaches?
Find out here.Research data on race and ethnicityMigraine can be a debilitating condition that is underdiagnosed and challenging to treat.
This can be seen especially in BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) populations.
People of Color are less likely to receive the diagnosis of migraine and the treatment than white people.
In fact, only 47% of African AmericansTrusted Source have an official migraine diagnosis, compared with 70% of white people in the country.
And other research found that Latino people are 50% less likely to receive a formal migraine diagnosis than white people.
These disparities can impact treatment and therapies.
While these figures could lead to the conclusion that white people experience more migraine episodes than other groups, an analysis of nine studiesTrusted Source looking at the average prevalence of severe headache or migraine from 2005 to 2012 in the U.S. found that the prevalence rates of episodes across all groups were similar:17.7% of Native American people15.5% of white people14.5% of Hispanic people14.45% of Black people9.2% of Asian people Furthermore, females in all groups were approximately twice as likely to experience migraine episodes than males.
Overall, studies that discuss migraine and use racial and ethnic differences for clarity often do not consider contributing factors.
Further research is warranted, and this should consider behavioral, environmental, genetic, and socioeconomic factors, as well as access to healthcare.Risk factorsAnyone can develop migraine, and there is a slightly higher risk for people with:depressionbipolar disorderfibromyalgiairritable bowel syndromeoveractive bladdersleep disordersobsessive-compulsive disorderanxietyIs there a link between migraine and COVID-19?TreatmentThere is no cure for migraine.
However, medications can treat the symptoms when they arise, and people can take steps to reduce the frequency and severity of episodes.
But keep in mind that these medications can have side effects.MedicationsPain relief and other types of medication can often help.
Taking medication as soon as symptoms start may keep them from becoming severe.Some over-the-counter pain relief medications that may benefit people with migraine include:naproxen (Aleve)ibuprofen (Advil)acetaminophen (Tylenol)Other options include:triptans, such as sumatriptan (Imitrex), to help reverse the brain changes that occur during an episodeantiemetics to manage any nausea and vomitinggepants to block a protein involved in inflammation and pain, called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)ditans, which interact with 5-HT1F receptors on the sensory nerves and blood vesselsIt is important to avoid overusing medication because overuse can cause a rebound headache.
A healthcare professional can help a person decide how much of each medication is safe and effective.
Find some tips for instant migraine relief here.Home and natural remediesSome home care strategies that can help relieve migraine symptoms include:using flexible cold packs or masksstaying in a quiet, darkened roomsleeping, when necessaryThe following supplements might help prevent migraine.
However, there is limited evidence that they work, and not much is known about their side effects:herbal extracts, such as feverfewmagnesiumcoenzyme 10butterburriboflavinOther nondrug approaches may include acupunctureTrusted Source and neck exercises or physical therapy.Before trying any of these, speak with a healthcare professional.
Research has not shown that these approaches work.
Various products that claim to help relieve migraine are available for purchase online.Anyone looking for an alternative therapy, such as acupuncture, should go to a qualified and experienced professional.What are some natural remedies for a headache?How to prevent migraine episodesWhile it is not always possible to prevent migraine episodes, there are ways to reduce their frequency and severity.MedicationsThe following prescription drugs may help reduce the number of episodes that a person with severe migraine experiences:topiramate (Trokendi XR), an antiseizure drugpropanolol (Inderal), for treating high blood pressureantidepressant medicationsBotoxgepants and CGRP inhibitorsIt may take several weeks to see an improvement.
The best treatment in children or adolescents may be different from that in adults.
A healthcare professional can help recommend the most effective approach.Identifying and avoiding triggersA migraine episode sometimes happens in response to a trigger.
To identify a trigger, a person might keep a diary and record how they felt and what they did, ate, and drank before the symptoms appeared.It may be particularly helpful to avoid: low blood sugarphysical overexertionstresscertain foods, such as chocolate and any that contain tyramine or MSGcertain medications, including HRT and some birth control pillsbright lights and flickering screensThe following strategies may help reduce the frequency of migraine episodes:getting enough sleepreducing stressdrinking plenty of waterhaving healthy postureavoiding known dietary triggers, such as caffeine, alcohol, and cheesegetting regular physical exerciseIf making these changes does not ease the severity and frequency of migraine episodes, a doctor may suggest medication or other options.
TypesThere are various types of migraine.
A major distinguishing factor is whether they involve aura — sensory changes.
Migraine with auraAura is a disturbance of the senses in the early stages of a migraine episode.Aura can involve:having confusing thoughts or experiencesseeing strange, sparkling, or flashing lights that are not thereseeing zig-zagging lines of lighthaving blind spots or blank patches in the field of visionhaving a pins and needles sensation in an arm or leghaving difficulty speakinghaving weakness in the shoulders, neck, or limbsseeing things that are not there out of one eye, such as transparent strings of objectsnot being able to see part of something clearlyhaving part of the field of vision disappear, then reappearA visual aura may feel like the aftermath of a very bright camera flash, but the visual changes may last for several minutes or up to 1 hour.
Anyone experiencing an aura for the first time should contact a healthcare professional to rule out serious neurological problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor.Find out more about migraine aura here.Migraine without auraMore commonly, a person experiences no sensory disturbances before an episode.
According to the Migraine Trust, 70–90% of episodes occur without aura.Other typesSome other types of migraine include:Chronic migraine: This involves having an episode on more than 15 days per month.Menstrual migraine: This occurs in a pattern that follows the menstrual cycle.Hemiplegic migraine: This causes temporary weakness on one side of the body, and it is very rare.Abdominal migraine: This involves migraine episodes with irregular function in the gut and abdomen, often with nausea or vomiting.
It mainly affects children under 14 years of age.Vestibular migraine: Severe vertigo is a symptom of this type.Basilar migraine: This rare type is also called “migraine with brainstem aura,” and it can affect neurological functions, such as speech.
Anyone who may be experiencing any neurological symptoms should get medical attention.
And people who need treatment for migraine should consult a healthcare professional.DiagnosisThe International Headache Society recommends the “5, 4, 3, 2, 1” criteria to diagnose migraine without aura.
These numbers stand for:having 5 or more episodes, each lasting 4 hours to 3 dayshaving a headache with at least 2 of the following qualities: – occurring on one side– pulsating– causing moderate-to-severe pain aggravated by activityhaving at least 1 additional symptom, such as: – nausea– vomiting– sensitivity to light– sensitivity to soundThe doctor may recommend imaging or other tests to exclude other causes of the symptoms, such as a tumor, meningitis, or a stroke.
When to see a doctorA person should consult a healthcare professional if they experience: what seems like a first migraine episode worsening or unusual migraine symptomssevere symptomsIf any of the following occur, seek immediate medical help:an unusually severe headachevisual disturbancesa loss of sensationdifficulty speakingThese could indicate another condition that may need urgent attention, such as a stroke.
When is it sensible to worry about a headache?SummaryMigraine is a medical condition that involves a headache and other symptoms.
It is not just a bad headache, and it can have a significant impact on daily life, making it difficult to work and do everyday activities.
Identifying and avoiding triggers can often help reduce the frequency or severity of episodes, though it is not always possible to prevent them.Medication and other treatments can help manage migraine symptoms.
Anyone who has concerns should contact a healthcare professional.Read the article in Spanish.         What are the symptoms of a migraine?
Individual migraines are moderate to severe in intensity, often characterized by a throbbing or pounding feeling.
Although they are frequently one-sided, they may occur anywhere on the head, neck and face — or all over.
At their worst, they are typically associated with sensitivity to light, noise and/or smells.
Nausea is one of the most common symptoms and it worsens with activity, which often results in patient disability.
In many respects, migraines are much like alcohol-related hangovers.
Migraine pain can be felt in the face, where it may be mistaken for sinus headache — or in the neck, where it may be mistaken for arthritis or muscle spasm.
Complicating the diagnosis of migraine is that the headaches may be accompanied by other "sinus like" symptoms, including watering eyes, nasal congestion and a sense of facial pressure.
Most patients who think they have sinus headache in fact have migraines.
In up to 25 percent of patients, the migraine headache pain may be preceded by an aura, a temporary neurological syndrome that slowly progresses and then typically resolves just as the pain begins.
While the most common type of migraine aura involves visual disturbances (flashing lights, zigzags, blind spots), many people experience numbness, confusion, trouble speaking, vertigo (spinning dizziness) and other strokelike neurological symptoms.
Some patients may experience auras without headaches.
How prevalent are migraines?
Migraines are about three times more common in women than men, and may affect more than 12 percent of the U.S. adult population.
Migraines often run in families, and can start as early as elementary school but most often in early adulthood.
They often fade away later in life, but can strike at any time.
The most common cause of recurring, disabling headache pain, migraines are also the most common underlying cause of disabling chronic, daily headache pain.
While migraines are the No.
1 reason that patients see a neurologist, most cases are handled by primary care physicians.
What triggers a migraine?
Things that can make the headaches more likely to occur include:           Alcohol               Weather changes               Lack of sleep               Schedule changes               Dehydration               Hunger               Certain foods               Strong smells               Teeth grinding at night               Menstruation       How are migraines diagnosed?
Despite their dramatic symptoms, migraines are almost never due to an underlying problem that will show up on any testing, even on brain MRIs.
Many experts do not recommend brain imaging at all, even in severe cases, as long as the patient's symptoms are typical for migraines and a thorough neurological examination is normal.
There are extremely rare families that have migraines as a result of a single genetic mutation in one of four known genes that can lead to the condition called familial hemiplegic migraine.
There are no genetic tests for the vast majority of patients.
Because the condition cannot be diagnosed by scan or blood test, the diagnosis is "clinical" — made by an experienced physician.
How are migraines treated?
Migraines that are severe, frequent or accompanied by neurological symptoms are best treated preventively, usually with a combination of dietary modification, lifestyle changes, vitamins and daily prescription medications.
Most of our best preventive medications are often used for other medical purposes as well; the majority are blood pressure drugs, antidepressants or epilepsy medications.
Individual headache attacks are best treated early, often with one or more of the following types of medications: triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-emetics (anti-nausea), and sometimes narcotics or steroids.
Migraines typically last a few hours to a couple of days and respond well to specific treatments.
However, in some patients, the migraine is particularly severe and long-lasting — and may even become chronic, occurring continuously for weeks, months or even years.
If improperly managed or left untreated, intermittent migraines may essentially transform into a chronic daily headache, with continuous and smoldering symptoms that periodically erupt into a "full-blown" migraine.
This condition is extremely difficult to treat.
Other patients may develop increasingly frequent headaches as a result of overusing their short-acting headache medications.
See medication overuse headache.
While they are considered primary headaches, meaning they have no known underlying cause, migraines are associated with an increased risk of stroke, brain scarring as seen on MRI scans, a heart defect called a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and other medical conditions.
At the Johns Hopkins Headache Center, located at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical center, we have expert physical therapists, nutritionists and psychologists who work closely with our neurologists to help manage patients with frequent migraines.
Biofeedback and relaxation techniques are available to complement our standard medical treatments.

You can experience up to four phases during a migraine episode, each of which can be recognized by its own set of characteristics.
Your migraine attacks may not all be exactly the same, but recognizing the range of symptoms that can occur can help tip you off as to if what you're experiencing could be a migraine.
If you're already diagnosed, knowing where these symptoms fit into the typical sequence of stages can help you decide when to take your medication.
Migraines may result in medication-related complications, and rarely, a migraine can induce a serious health complication.
Other conditions, such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) and multiple sclerosis (MS) can produce symptoms similar to those of a migraine, so you may need to seek medical attention if you have any warning signs.

Frequent Symptoms    Migraine episodes can include several stages: prodome, aura, headache, and postdrome.
You may cycle through all of these phases when you have a migraine, or you might experience just one, two, or three of them.
The headache phase is the most common, while the aura is the least common.
Prodrome    The prodrome is characterized by premonitory symptoms of an impending migraine and it can begin hours or days before a migraine episode reaches its peak intensity.
Most people with migraine experience prodromal symptoms, and taking migraine medication during this stage may stop the episode from progressing.
Typical symptoms during a prodrome are:1﻿          Food cravings Constipation or diarrhea Mood changes: sadness, irritability, anxiety Muscle stiffness or soreness, especially in the neck Fatigue Excessive yawning Nausea Fluid retention, bloating Increased frequency of urination Difficulty concentrating Vivid dreams Sensitivity to light, sounds, or smells Feeling cold           Aura    Approximately one-third of migraineurs experience aura, which usually follows the prodrome and lasts for less than an hour.2﻿ This stage is characterized by neurological symptoms, and it can be quite terrifying, especially when you experience it for the first time.
Symptoms of a migraine aura can include:    Visual changes: flashing lights, wavy lines, spots, partial loss of vision, blind spot, blurry vision Tingling, numbness, or hypersensitivity of the face or extremities Vertigo (a sense that the room is spinning) Difficulty finding words and/or speaking Confusion Partial paralysis Olfactory hallucinations (smelling odors that aren't there) Auditory hallucinations (hearing things that are not there) A decrease or loss of hearing          An Overview of Migraine With Aura     Headache    The head pain of a migraine is often described as throbbing, pounding, or pulsating.
You may also experience other symptoms along with the head pain.
This phase usually lasts from four to 72 hours.1﻿    Common characteristics of the headache phase may include:    Hemicranial (on one side of the head) pain that can shift to the other side or become bilateral Phonophobia (sensitivity to sound) Photophobia (sensitivity to light) Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea or constipation Nasal congestion and/or runny nose Sadness or anxiety Hot flashes and chills Dizziness Dehydration or fluid retention     Migraine effects are not limited to the head and often affect the neck, shoulders, arms, or the entire body.
The symptoms are often worsened by activities such as walking, riding in a car, or exercising.
Postdrome    After the most intense phase of a migraine, you may experience a postdrome before your migraine attack is completely over.
The symptoms of postdrome include:1﻿    FatigueMood changes, which can include sadness, anxiety, or elevated moodMuscle achesDizziness or lightheadednessDifficulty concentratingStiff neckScalp tenderness    Many people describe postdrome as feeling "like a zombie" or hungover.
Postdromal symptoms can be associated with abnormal cerebral blood flow and electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns for up to 24 hours after the end of the headache stage.3﻿ Even if you do not experience the headache stage, you may still experience a postdrome phase.
Concurrent Phases  Migraine stages may overlap, sometimes with the aura occurring at the same time as the prodrome, headache, or postdrome.
Prodromal symptoms may linger even as the headache peaks, and postdromal symptoms can begin before the headache starts to resolve.
Childhood Migraines    Children also experience migraines, and the symptoms can differ from those of adults.
If you note the following symptoms in your child, migraines may be the cause, especially if your child has a family history of the condition:4    StomachacheNauseaDizzinessMotion sicknessMoodinessExcessive sleepiness    Be sure to discuss these symptoms with your healthcare provider.
They could be signs of another medical condition, but if migraines are the cause, your child can take medication to help prevent and treat episodes.
When Children Have Migraines      Rare Symptoms    Rare symptoms are typically associated with migraine subtypes, and while they may be similar to a migraine aura, the main difference is that these unusual symptoms are usually the most prominent aspect of the migraine episodes.
Weakness    Weakness, typically in one arm, occurs with hemiplegic migraine.5﻿ If you have hemiplegic migraines, you may also experience several migraine stages and other aura symptoms.
There is a strong hereditary tendency to develop this type of migraine.
Stomachaches    More common in children than adults, abdominal migraine is characterized by stomachaches that occur without a gastrointestinal cause and may involve nausea and vomiting.
Paralysis of Eye Movement    Double vision, blurred vision, a droopy eyelid, or an obvious inability to move one eye can be a sign of ophthalmoplegic migraine.
Absent Headache    Although not very common, you can have a migraine aura without a headache.
There are several terms used to describe this experience, including "silent migraine," "sans-migraine," and "migraine equivalent."
When There's No Headache, Is It Still a Migraine?
Complications/ Sub-Group Indications    Migraines do not typically cause complications, although they can.
The most common complications are related to medication use.
Medication Effects    Side effects of overuse can include stomach pain and gastrointestinal bleeding from taking high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs).
Other medications, including triptans and ergot medications, can cause side effects such as dizziness, tingling, or even vascular complications when taken at higher doses than directed.
Keep in mind that all medications—whether over-the-counter or prescription— can cause side effects even at recommended doses.
Medication rebound headaches or medication withdrawal headaches can occur when you take migraine medications at high doses or for a prolonged time and then abruptly stop.
Be sure to discuss a medication plan with your healthcare provider—and if it isn't working, then discuss another plan instead of taking extra medication to deal with your migraines.
Medications That Cause Overuse Headaches     Migraine Complications    Complications from a migraine itself include some serious concerns that require medical attention:    Status migrainosus: If your migraine lasts longer than 72 hours despite treatment, it's termed status migrainosus, a condition that is unlikely to resolve with your regular prescription.
You should seek medical attention because you may need treatment with intravenous (IV) medication.6﻿    Migrainous infarction: An infarction in the brain is a type of stroke caused by lack of blood flow.
A migrainous infarction begins with migraine symptoms that can eventually involve stroke symptoms and may produce permanent neurological effects.
Seizure: A convulsive episode that may be characterized by involuntary shaking or jerking may occur as a result of a migraine.
The physiological reason for this complication is not well understood.
Migraine Complications      When to See a Healthcare Provider/Go to the Hospital    Migraines do not normally require emergency medical attention.
The treatment is really based on a plan for both prevention and treatment of acute attacks.
Nevertheless, when you are not sure if your symptoms are caused by a migraine, or when your migraine pattern changes, you need to seek medical attention.
Urgent Medical Care    Symptoms such as paralysis, loss of sensation, difficulty communicating, loss of vision, and double vision can all be manifestations of a stroke, MS, meningitis, seizures, and other neurological illnesses.7﻿ If you experience any of these rare symptoms and they have not been attributed to migraines (or if you're unsure of their connection), then you should get prompt medical attention.
Even if you have a diagnosis of migraines, you should have a medical evaluation if your headaches occur with certain features, including:    The worst headache of your lifeFeversRecurrent vomiting/can't keep anything downHead traumaFalling/ inability to balance     Talk to Your Healthcare Provider    If your migraine pattern changes in frequency or intensity or if your symptoms change, you should talk to your healthcare provider.
You may need a diagnostic evaluation or a change in your treatment plan.
