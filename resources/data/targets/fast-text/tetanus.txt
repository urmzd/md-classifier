Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a serious but preventable disease that affects the body's muscles and nerves.It's often referred to as "lockjaw" because it can cause painful spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles.Tetanus is a serious infection that can be life-threatening, and is easily prevented with vaccination.
It is caused by a toxin produced by spores of the bacteria Clostridium tetani.
These bacteria live in the environment, including in soil, dust, and animal feces, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Any time you get a wound that may become contaminated with soil or environmental contents, you are at risk for tetanus.Once the bacteria get into the wound, they can produce a toxin that affects the abilities of muscles to work.
This can cause stiffening and rigidity of muscles, which is a very serious condition, especially once it affects the muscles used to breathe, notes the Mayo Clinic.The disease can lead to serious complications, and even death.
Tetanus is a medical emergency that requires treatment in a hospital.Most cases occur in people who have not been vaccinated.What is tetanus?
— Tetanus is a serious infection that causes muscle stiffness and spasms.
It is sometimes called "lockjaw" because muscle spasms can clench the jaw shut.Tetanus is caused by bacteria (germs) that live in the soil.
They can get into the body through a cut or scrape.
They can also get into the body if a person uses a needle to inject illegal drugs.
Most people in the United States are protected from these bacteria because they have gotten vaccines against them.What are the symptoms of tetanus?
— The symptoms include:●Stiff jaw or neck muscles, which make it hard to move your jaw or neck normally●Strange-looking smile that does not go away when you try to relax your mouth●Tight, painful muscles that do not let go when you try to relax them●Trouble breathing, swallowing, or both●Feeling irritable or restless●Sweating even when you are not exercising or hot●Heartbeat that is faster than usual, or irregular heartbeat●Fever●Painful muscle spasmsPeople who are very sick with tetanus can have muscle spasms that force the body into a "bridge" position.
They might have:●Clenched fists●Back arched off the floor or bed●Legs stretched out●Arms moving back and forth●Trouble breathing – They might even stop breathing during a muscle spasm.Should I see a doctor or nurse?
— See your doctor or nurse right away if:●You get a puncture wound, for example from a nail that goes through your skin.●You get a cut, scrape, or other injury you cannot clean completely.●You have an injury that leaves something (like a nail or glass) inside your body.●An animal bites you.●You have diabetes, and get a sore on your foot, leg, or other place.●You have a stiff jaw or neck, other tight muscles you cannot relax, or painful muscle spasms.●You have trouble breathing or swallowing.It is especially important to see a doctor or nurse if you get a puncture wound or animal bite and your last tetanus shot was 5 years ago or longer, or if you do not remember getting a tetanus shot.Is there a test for tetanus?
— No.
There is no simple test.
But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and vaccine history, and by doing an exam.
This infection is most likely in people who have had an injury and who have not had the tetanus vaccine at all or not had the right vaccine boosters.Is tetanus dangerous?
— Yes.
People with tetanus need to go to the hospital, and some people even die from it.
The muscle spasms can stop your breathing.How is tetanus treated?
— Doctors treat tetanus in the hospital, sometimes in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Treatments include:●Cleaning cuts or scrapes to remove skin and tissue that could have tetanus bacteria on it●Giving medicines to fight the infection●Giving a tetanus vaccine booster●Giving medicine and other treatments to reduce muscle spasms, breathing problems, pain, and other symptoms●Using a ventilator (breathing machine) if you have trouble breathing on your own●Using a feeding tube if you cannot eat or drink on your own●Having physical therapy to help muscles recoverCan tetanus be prevented?
— Yes.
To reduce your chances of getting tetanus, do these things:●Get a tetanus vaccine.
This teaches your body how to fight tetanus.
Most children growing up in the United States get this vaccine as part of their routine childhood vaccines.●Get regular tetanus booster shots.
Adults should get tetanus booster shots every 10 years.
For bad wounds, you will need to get a tetanus booster shot if you haven't had one in the last 5 years.
If you have a bad wound and you haven't received all of your tetanus vaccines or you are not sure if you have, you will need a tetanus booster shot and another shot to fight any tetanus bacteria that got in the wound.●Wash cuts or scrapes with soap and water and use antibiotic ointment on them.
See a doctor or nurse if you cannot get all the dirt out or cannot see all the way into the wound.●Do not inject illegal drugs, or at least use clean needles if you do inject drugs or anything else.More on this topic Patient education: Taking care of cuts and scrapes (The Basics) Patient education: Animal and human bites (The Basics) Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics) Patient education: What you should know about vaccines (The Basics) Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics) Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics) Patient education: Vaccines for adults (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?

The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles.
Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw.
Severe complications of tetanus can be life-threatening.
There's no cure for tetanus.
Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve.
Because of the widespread use of vaccines, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world.
The disease remains a threat to people who aren't up to date on their vaccinations.
It's more common in developing countries.Products & ServicesBook: Mayo Clinic Guide to Raising a Healthy Child                                                                                              SymptomsThe average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days.
The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days.
The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus.
Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks.
They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body.
Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include:      Painful muscle spasms and stiff, immovable muscles (muscle rigidity) in your jaw     Tension of muscles around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin     Painful spasms and rigidity in your neck muscles     Difficulty swallowing     Rigid abdominal muscles  Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms).
Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched.
Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties.
These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light.
As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include:      High blood pressure     Low blood pressure     Rapid heart rate     Fever     Extreme sweating                                    Localized tetanusThis uncommon form of tetanus results in muscles spasms near the site of a wound.
While it's usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus.
Cephalic tetanusThis rare form of tetanus results from a head wound.
It results in weakened muscles in the face and spasms of the jaw muscles.
It also can progress to generalized tetanus.
When to see a doctorTetanus is a life-threatening disease.
If you have signs or symptoms of tetanus, seek emergency care.
If you have a simple, clean wound — and you've had a tetanus shot within 10 years — you can care for your wound at home.
Seek medical care in the following cases:      You've not had a tetanus shot within 10 years.
You are unsure of when you last had a tetanus shot.
You have a puncture wound, a foreign object in your wound, an animal bite or a deep cut.
Your wound is contaminated with dirt, soil, feces, rust or saliva — or you have any doubt about whether you've cleaned a wound sufficiently after such exposure.
Contaminated wounds require a vaccination booster if it's been five or more years since your last tetanus shot.
Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic                                                      CausesThe bacterium that causes tetanus is called Clostridium tetani.
The bacterium can survive in a dormant state in soil and animal feces.
It's essentially shut down until it discovers a place to thrive.
When the dormant bacteria enter a wound — a condition good for growth — the cells are "awakened."
As they are growing and dividing, they release a toxin called tetanospasmin.
The toxin impairs the nerves in the body that control muscles.
Risk factorsThe greatest risk factor for tetanus infection is not being vaccinated or not keeping up with the 10-year booster shots.
Other factors that increase the risk of tetanus infection are:      Cuts or wounds exposed to soil or manure     A foreign body in a wound, such as a nail or splinter     A history of immune-suppressing medical conditions     Infected skin lesions in people living with diabetes     An infected umbilical cord when a mother isn't fully vaccinated     Shared and unsanitary needles for illegal drug use                                    ComplicationsComplications of tetanus infection may include:      Breathing problems.
Life-threatening breathing problems can occur from tightening of the vocal cords and muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen, especially during a generalized spasm.
Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism).
A blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches.
Pneumonia.
A lung infection caused by accidentally inhaling something into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia) may be a complication of generalized spasms.
Broken bones.
Generalized spasms may cause fractures of the spine or other bones.
Death.
Death from tetanus is often caused by a blocked airway during spasms or damage to the nerves that regulate breathing, heart rate or other organ functions.
PreventionYou can prevent tetanus by being vaccinated.
Vaccination for childrenThe tetanus vaccine is given to children as part of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP).
Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection of the nose and throat.
Acellular pertussis, also called whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory infection.
Children who do not tolerate the pertussis vaccine may receive the alternative vaccine called DT.
The DTaP is a series of five shots typically given in the arm or thigh to children at ages:      2 months     4 months     6 months     15 to 18 months     4 to 6 years                                    Vaccination for children ages 7 to 18A booster shot is recommended for children at age 11 or 12.
This booster is called the Tdap vaccine.
If your child didn't get a booster shot as this age, talk to your doctor about appropriate options.
Vaccination for adults age 19 and olderA booster shot is recommended for adults once every 10 years.
This may be one of two vaccines, Tdap or Td.
If you weren't vaccinated against tetanus as a child or are unsure about your vaccination status, see your doctor about getting the Tdap vaccine.
Vaccination during pregnancyA booster is recommended during the third trimester of a pregnancy, regardless of the mother's vaccination schedule.
Other recommendations     Ask your doctor to review your vaccination status regularly.
Check whether you are current on your vaccination schedule if you are planning international travel.

[1] In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body.
[1] Each spasm usually lasts a few minutes.
[1] Spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks.
[1] Some spasms may be severe enough to fracture bones.
[6] Other symptoms of tetanus may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate.
[1][6] Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection.
[1] Recovery may take months.
[1] About ten percent of cases prove to be fatal.
[1] Tetanus is caused by an infection with the bacterium Clostridium tetani,[1] which is commonly found in soil, saliva, dust, and manure.
[2] The bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object.
[2] They produce toxins that interfere with normal muscle contractions.
[3] Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms.
[1] The disease does not spread between people.
[1] Tetanus can be prevented by immunization with the tetanus vaccine.
[1] In those who have a significant wound and have had fewer than three doses of the vaccine, both vaccination and tetanus immune globulin are recommended.
[1] The wound should be cleaned and any dead tissue should be removed.
[1] In those who are infected, tetanus immune globulin or, if unavailable, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used.
[1] Muscle relaxants may be used to control spasms.
[3] Mechanical ventilation may be required if a person's breathing is affected.
[3] Tetanus occurs in all parts of the world but is most frequent in hot and wet climates where the soil has a high organic content.
[1] In 2015 there were about 209,000 infections and about 59,000 deaths globally.
[4][5] This is down from 356,000 deaths in 1990.
[7] In the US there are about 30 cases per year, almost all of which have not been vaccinated.
[8] An early description of the disease was made by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC.
[1] The cause of the disease was determined in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone at the University of Turin, and a vaccine was developed in 1924.

The spasms can also affect the facial muscles resulting in an appearance called risus sardonicus.
Chest, neck, back, abdominal muscles and buttocks may be affected.
Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called opisthotonos.
Sometimes the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing, which can lead to breathing problems.
[9] Prolonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups, which is called "tetany".
These episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears.
Other symptoms include fever, headache, restlessness, irritability, feeding difficulties, breathing problems, burning sensation during urination, urinary retention and loss of stool control.
[10] Even with treatment, about 10% of people who contract tetanus die.
[1] The mortality rate is higher in unvaccinated people and people over 60 years of age.
[1]  Incubation period[edit] The incubation period of tetanus may be up to several months, but is usually about ten days.
[11][12] In general, the farther the injury site is from the central nervous system, the longer the incubation period.
The shorter the incubation period, the more severe the symptoms.
[13] In trismus nascentium (i.e.
neonatal tetanus), symptoms usually appear from 4 to 14 days after birth, averaging about 7 days.
On the basis of clinical findings, four different forms of tetanus have been described.
[1]  Generalized tetanus[edit] Generalized tetanus is the most common type of tetanus, representing about 80% of cases.
The generalized form usually presents with a descending pattern.
The first sign is trismus or lockjaw, and the facial spasms are called risus sardonicus, followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, and rigidity of pectoral and calf muscles.
Other symptoms include elevated temperature, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and episodic rapid heart rate.
Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes with the body shaped into a characteristic form called opisthotonos.
Spasms continue for up to four weeks, and complete recovery may take months.
[1]  Neonatal tetanus[edit] Main article: Neonatal tetanus Neonatal tetanus (trismus nascentium) is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns, usually those born to mothers who themselves have not been vaccinated.
If the mother has been vaccinated against tetanus, the infants acquire passive immunity and are thus protected.
[14] It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument.
As of 1998 neonatal tetanus was common in many developing countries and was responsible for about 14% (215,000) of all neonatal deaths.
[15] In 2010 the worldwide death toll was 58,000 newborns.
As the result of a public health campaign, the death toll from neonatal tetanus was reduced by 90% between 1990 and 2010, and by 2013 the disease had been largely eliminated from all but 25 countries.
[16] Neonatal tetanus is rare in developed countries.
Local tetanus[edit] Local tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease, in which people have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury.
The contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding.
Local tetanus is generally milder; only about 1% of cases are fatal, but it may precede the onset of generalized tetanus.
[1]  Cephalic tetanus[edit] Cephalic tetanus is the rarest form of the disease (0.9–3% of cases)[17] and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head.
[18] It usually occurs after trauma to the head area, including skull fracture,[19] laceration,[19] eye injury,[18] dental extraction,[20] and otitis media,[21] but it has been observed from injuries to other parts of the body.
[22] Paralysis of the facial nerve is most frequently implicated, which may cause lockjaw, facial palsy, or ptosis, but other cranial nerves can also be affected.
[20][23] Cephalic tetanus may progress to a more generalized form of the disease.
[17][23] Due to its rarity, clinicians may be unfamiliar with the clinical presentation and may not suspect tetanus as the illness.
[18] Treatment can be complicated as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection.
[19] Cephalic tetanus is more likely than other forms of tetanus to be fatal, with the progression to generalized tetanus carrying a 15–30% case fatality rate.
[17][19][23]  Cause[edit]   Clostridium tetani is durable due to its endospores.
Pictured is the bacterium alone, with a spore being produced, and the spore alone.
Tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacterium Clostridium tetani.
[1] Tetanus is an international health problem, as C. tetani endospores are ubiquitous.
Endospores can be introduced into the body through a puncture wound (penetrating trauma).
Due to C. tetani being an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen, such as a puncture wound.
With the changes in oxygen levels, the drum stick-shaped endospore can result in quick spread.
[24] The disease occurs almost exclusively in persons inadequately immunized.
[25] It is more common in hot, damp climates with soil rich in organic matter.
Manure-treated soils may contain spores, as they are widely distributed in the intestines and feces of many animals such as horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens.
[1] In agricultural areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism.
[26] The spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated heroin.
[1] Heroin users, particularly those who inject the drug subcutaneously, appear to be at high risk of contracting tetanus.
[1] Rarely, tetanus can be contracted through surgical procedures, intramuscular injections, compound fractures, and dental infections.
[1] Animal bites can transmit tetanus.
[1] Tetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails.
Although rust itself does not cause tetanus, objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbor anaerobic bacteria.
Additionally, the rough surface of rusty metal provides crevices for dirt containing C. tetani, while a nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound.
[27] An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment.
Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment may exist under the skin, and the puncturing object can deliver endospores to a suitable environment for growth.
[28] It is a common misconception that rust itself is the cause and that a puncture from a rust-free nail is not a risk.
[29][30]  Pathophysiology[edit]   A neurotransmitter-filled vesicle before and after exposure to the tetanus toxin.
The cleavage of the VAMP protein by the toxin inhibits vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release into the synapse.
Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) binds to the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, is internalized and is transported back through the axon until it reaches the central nervous system.
[31] Here, it selectively binds to and is transported into inhibitory neurons via endocytosis.
[32] It then leaves the vesicle for the neuron cytosol where it cleaves vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) synaptobrevin, which is necessary for membrane fusion of small synaptic vesicles (SSV's).
[31] SSV's carry neurotransmitter to the membrane for release, so inhibition of this process blocks neurotransmitter release.
[citation needed] Tetanus toxin specifically blocks the release of the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine from inhibitory neurons.
These neurotransmitters keep overactive motor neurons from firing and also play a role in the relaxation of muscles after contraction.
When inhibitory neurons are unable to release their neurotransmitters, motor neurons fire out of control and muscles have difficulty relaxing.
This causes the muscle spasms and spastic paralysis seen in tetanus infection.
[31] The tetanus toxin, tetanospasmin, is made up of a heavy chain and a light chain.
There are three domains, each of which contributes to the pathophysiology of the toxin.
[33] The heavy chain has two of the domains.
The N-terminal side of the heavy chain helps with membrane translocation, and the C-terminal side helps the toxin locate the specific receptor site on the correct neuron.
The light chain domain cleaves the VAMP protein once it arrives in the inhibitory neuron cytosol.
[33] There are four main steps in tetanus's mechanism of action: binding to the neuron, internalization of the toxin, membrane translocation, and cleavage of the target VAMP.
[citation needed]  Neurospecific binding[edit] The toxin travels from the wound site to the neuromuscular junction through the bloodstream where it binds to the presynaptic membrane of a motor neuron.
The heavy chain C-terminal domain aids in the binding to the correct site, recognizing and binding to the correct glycoproteins and glycolipids in the presynaptic membrane.
The toxin binds to a site that will be taken into the neuron as an endocytic vesicle that will travel down the axon, past the cell body, and down the dendrites to the dendritic terminal at the spine and central nervous system.
Here it will be released into the synaptic cleft and allowed to bind with the presynaptic membrane of inhibitory neurons in a similar manner seen with the binding to the motor neuron.
[32]  Internalization[edit] Tetanus toxin is then internalized again via endocytosis, this time in an acidic vesicle.
[33] In a mechanism not well understood, depolarization caused by the firing of the inhibitory neuron causes the toxin to be pulled into the neuron inside vesicles.
[citation needed]  Membrane translocation[edit] The toxin then needs a way to get out of the vesicle and into the neuron cytosol for it to act on its target.
The low pH of the vesicle lumen causes a conformational change in the toxin, shifting it from a water-soluble form to a hydrophobic form.
[32] With the hydrophobic patches exposed, the toxin can slide into the vesicle membrane.
The toxin forms an ion channel in the membrane that is nonspecific for Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− ions.
[31] There is a consensus among experts that this new channel is involved in the translocation of the toxin's light chain from the inside of the vesicle to the neuron cytosol, but the mechanism is not well understood or agreed upon.
It has been proposed that the channel could allow the light chain (unfolded from the low pH environment) to leave through the toxin pore,[34] or that the pore could alter the electrochemical gradient enough, by letting in or out ions, to cause osmotic lysis of the vesicle, spilling the vesicle's contents.
[35]  Enzymatic target cleavage[edit] The light chain of the tetanus toxin is zinc-dependent protease.
It shares a common zinc protease motif (His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His) that researchers hypothesized was essential for target cleavage until this was more recently confirmed by experiment: when all zinc was removed from the neuron with heavy metal chelators, the toxin was inhibited, only to be reactivated when the zinc was added back in.
[31] The light chain binds to VAMP and cleaves it between Gln76 and Phe77.
Without VAMP, vesicles holding the neurotransmitters needed for motor neuron regulation (GABA and glycine) cannot be released, causing the above-mentioned deregulation of motor neurons and muscle tension.
[36]  Diagnosis[edit] There are currently no blood tests for diagnosing tetanus.
The diagnosis is based on the presentation of tetanus symptoms and does not depend upon isolation of the bacterium, which is recovered from the wound in only 30% of cases and can be isolated from people without tetanus.
Laboratory identification of C. tetani can be demonstrated only by production of tetanospasmin in mice.
[1] Having recently experienced head trauma may indicate cephalic tetanus if no other diagnosis has been made.
[citation needed] The "spatula test" is a clinical test for tetanus that involves touching the posterior pharyngeal wall with a soft-tipped instrument and observing the effect.
A positive test result is the involuntary contraction of the jaw (biting down on the "spatula") and a negative test result would normally be a gag reflex attempting to expel the foreign object.
A short report in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene states that, in an affected subject research study, the spatula test had a high specificity (zero false-positive test results) and a high sensitivity (94% of infected people produced a positive test).
[37]  Prevention[edit] Unlike many infectious diseases, recovery from naturally acquired tetanus does not usually result in immunity to tetanus.
This is due to the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin.
Tetanospasmin will likely be lethal before it will provoke an immune response.
[citation needed] Tetanus can be prevented by vaccination with tetanus toxoid.
[38] The CDC recommends that adults receive a booster vaccine every ten years,[1] and standard care practice in many places is to give the booster to any person with a puncture wound who is uncertain of when he or she was last vaccinated, or if he or she has had fewer than three lifetime doses of the vaccine.
The booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of tetanus from the current wound, however, as it can take up to two weeks for tetanus antibodies to form.
[39] In children under the age of seven, the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, DPT/DTaP vaccine, which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and pertussis.
For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) is commonly used.
[38] The World Health Organization certifies countries as having eliminated maternal or neonatal tetanus.
Certification requires at least two years of rates of less than 1 case per 1,000 live births.
In 1998 in Uganda, 3,433 tetanus cases were recorded in newborn babies; of these, 2,403 died.
After a major public health effort, Uganda in 2011 was certified as having eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus.
[40]  Post-exposure prophylaxis[edit] Tetanus toxoid can be given in case of suspected exposure to tetanus.
In such cases, it can be given with or without tetanus immunoglobulin (also called tetanus antibodies or tetanus antitoxin[41]).
It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.
The guidelines for such events in the United States for non-pregnant people 11 years and older are as follows:[1]    Vaccination status Clean, minor wounds All other wounds   Unknown or less than 3 doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine Tdap and recommend catch-up vaccination Tdap and recommend catch-up vaccination Tetanus immunoglobulin   3 or more doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine AND less than 5 years since the last dose  No indication No indication   3 or more doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine AND 5–10 years since the last dose  No indication Tdap preferred (if not yet received) or Td   3 or more doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine AND more than 10 years since the last dose  Tdap preferred (if not yet received) or Td Tdap preferred (if not yet received) or Td  Treatment[edit]   Tetanus deaths per million persons in 2012.mw-parser-output .refbegin{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul{margin-left:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul>li{margin-left:0;padding-left:3.2em;text-indent:-3.2em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents ul,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents ul li{list-style:none}@media(max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul>li{padding-left:1.6em;text-indent:-1.6em}}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}  0–1  1–2  2–3  4–8  9–13  14–28  29–151 Mild tetanus[edit] Mild cases of tetanus can be treated with:[42]  Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG),[1] also called tetanus antibodies or tetanus antitoxin.
[41] It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.
Antibiotic therapy to reduce toxin production.
Metronidazole intravenous (IV) is a preferred treatment.
[42] Benzodiazepines can be used to control muscle spasms.
Options include diazepam and lorazepam, oral or IV.
[42] Severe tetanus[edit] Severe cases will require admission to intensive care.
In addition to the measures listed above for mild tetanus:[42]  Human tetanus immunoglobulin injected intrathecally (which increases clinical improvement from 4% to 35%) Tracheotomy and mechanical ventilation for 3 to 4 weeks.
Tracheotomy is recommended for securing the airway because the presence of an endotracheal tube is a stimulus for spasm Magnesium sulfate, as an intravenous infusion, to control spasm and autonomic dysfunction Diazepam as a continuous IV infusion The autonomic effects of tetanus can be difficult to manage (alternating hyper- and hypotension hyperpyrexia/hypothermia) and may require IV labetalol, magnesium, clonidine, or nifedipine Drugs such as diazepam or other muscle relaxants can be given to control the muscle spasms.
In extreme cases it may be necessary to paralyze the person with curare-like drugs and use a mechanical ventilator.
To survive a tetanus infection, the maintenance of an airway and proper nutrition are required.
An intake of 3,500 to 4,000 calories and at least 150 g of protein per day is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), or through a drip into a vein (parenteral nutrition).
This high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain brought on by the increased muscle activity.
Full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve axon terminals.
[citation needed] The antibiotic of choice is metronidazole.
It can be given as intravenously, by mouth, or by rectum.
[43][42] Of likewise efficiency is penicillin, but some raise the concern of provoking spasms because it inhibits GABA receptor, which is already affected by tetanospasmin.
[44]  Epidemiology[edit]   Disability-adjusted life year for tetanus per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.   no data   ≤10   10-25   25-50   50-75   75-100   100-125   125-150   150-200   200-250   250-500   500-750   ≥750  In 2013 it caused about 59,000 deaths – down from 356,000 in 1990.
[7] Tetanus – in particular, the neonatal form – remains a significant public health problem in non-industrialized countries with 59,000 newborns worldwide dying in 2008 as a result of neonatal tetanus.
[45][46] In the United States, from 2000 through 2007 an average of 31 cases were reported per year.
[1] Nearly all of the cases in the United States occur in unimmunized individuals or individuals who have allowed their inoculations to lapse.
[1]   		 			 			 Tetanus cases reported worldwide (1990-2004).
Ranging from some (in dark red) to very few (in light yellow) (grey, no data).
Tetanus deaths between 1990 and 2017 by age group[47]  			 		  History[edit] Tetanus was well known to ancient communities and civilizations who recognized the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms.
[48] In 1884, Arthur Nicolaier isolated the strychnine-like toxin of tetanus from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria.
The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone, two pathologists of the University of Turin, who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time.
They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus from a person with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves and testing their reactions while tetanus was spreading.
[1] In 1891, C. tetani was isolated from a human victim by Kitasato Shibasaburō, who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies.
In 1897, Edmond Nocard showed that tetanus antitoxin induced passive immunity in humans, and could be used for prophylaxis and treatment.
Tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed by P. Descombey in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during World War II.
[1]  Etymology[edit] The word tetanus comes from the Ancient Greek: τέτανος, romanized: tetanos, lit.
'taut', which is further from the Ancient Greek: τείνειν, romanized: teinein, lit.
'to stretch'.
[49]  Research[edit] There is insufficient evidence to recommending treating or preventing tetanus with vitamin C.[50]  See also[edit] Renshaw cell Tetanized state Tetanospasmin  References[edit] .mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}  ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj ak al am an ao ap aq ar as .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:"\"""\"""'""'"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Atkinson, William (May 2012).

The number is low because an effective tetanus vaccine is given as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.Most people who get tetanus have either not been vaccinated against it or did not complete the entire vaccination schedule.
How you get tetanus                                      Tetanus bacteria can survive for a long time outside the body and are commonly found in soil and the manure of animals such as horses and cows.If the bacteria enter the body through a wound they can quickly multiply and release a toxin that affects the nerves, causing symptoms such as muscle stiffness and spasms.The bacteria can get into your body through:cuts and grazestears or splits in the skinburnsanimal bitesbody piercings, tattoos and injectionseye injuriesinjecting contaminated drugsTetanus cannot be spread from person to person.
Symptoms of tetanus                                      The symptoms of tetanus usually start around 4 to 21 days after infection.
On average, they start after around 10 days.The main symptoms of tetanus include:stiffness in your jaw muscles (lockjaw), which can make it difficult to open your mouthpainful muscle spasms, which can make it difficult to breathe and swallowa high temperaturesweatinga rapid heartbeatIf it's not treated, the symptoms can get worse over the following hours and days.
When to get medical advice                                      Contact a GP or visit your nearest minor injuries unit if you're concerned about a wound, particularly if:it's a deep woundthere's dirt or something inside the woundyou have not been fully vaccinated for tetanus, or you're not sure if you haveA doctor will assess the wound and decide whether you need treatment and whether you need to go to hospital.Go to your nearest A&E immediately, or call 999 for an ambulance, if you get severe muscle stiffness or spasms.
How tetanus is treated                                      If a doctor thinks there's a chance you could develop tetanus from a wound, but you do not yet have any symptoms, they'll make sure your wound is thoroughly cleaned.
They may also give you an injection of tetanus immunoglobulin.If you have not been fully immunised for tetanus, or you're not sure whether you have, you may be given a dose of the tetanus vaccine.
You may also be given antibiotics.Tetanus immunoglobulin is a medicine containing antibodies that prevent the tetanus toxin working, stopping its effects on the nerves.
It provides immediate, but short-term, protection from tetanus.If you develop symptoms of tetanus, you'll usually need to be admitted to a hospital intensive care unit (ICU), where you may be given several different treatments.
These could include tetanus immunoglobulin, antibiotics, and medicine to help muscle stiffness and spasms.Most people who develop symptoms of tetanus do recover, but it can take several weeks or months.
Tetanus vaccination                                      The tetanus vaccine is given as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.The full course of vaccination includes 5 injections, usually given on the following schedule:the first 3 doses are given as part of the 6-in-1 vaccine at age 8, 12 and 16 weeksa booster dose is given as part of the 4-in-1 pre-school booster at age 3 years and 4 monthsa final dose is given as part of the 3-in-1 teenage booster at age 14This course of 5 injections should provide long-lasting protection against tetanus.
However, if you or your child has a deep or dirty wound, it's best to get medical advice.If you're not sure whether you've had the full vaccination course, contact your GP surgery for advice.
It's possible to fully vaccinate older children and adults who were not vaccinated when they were younger.
Tetanus travel jab                                      Tetanus is found throughout the world, so you should make sure you're fully vaccinated before travelling abroad.Contact your GP surgery for advice if you're planning to travel abroad and have not been fully vaccinated against tetanus, or you're going to an area with limited medical facilities and your last vaccine dose was more than 10 years ago.You'll be offered the 3-in-1 teenage booster.
This injection, which also protects against diphtheria and polio, is usually free on the NHS.If you've never had the tetanus vaccine before, you may be advised to have as many doses as possible before you travel.
There should be a 1-month gap between each dose.
If there's not enough time to have all the doses you need, you can complete the course when you return.Read more about travel vaccinations.

Tetanus infection can lead to serious health problems, including being unable to open the mouth and having trouble swallowing and breathing.
Symptoms Symptoms of tetanus include:     The first sign is most commonly spasms of the muscles of the jaw, or “lockjaw.”     Jaw cramping Sudden, involuntary muscle tightening (muscle spasms) — often in the stomach Painful muscle stiffness all over the body Trouble swallowing Jerking or staring (seizures) Headache Fever and sweating Changes in blood pressure and heart rate   Complications Serious health problems that can happen because of tetanus include:  Uncontrolled/involuntary tightening of the vocal cords (laryngospasm) Broken bones (fractures) Infections gotten by a patient during a hospital visit (hospital-acquired infections) Blockage of the main artery of the lung or one of its branches by a blood clot that has travelled from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (pulmonary embolism) Pneumonia, a lung infection, that develops by breathing in foreign materials (aspiration pneumonia) Breathing difficulty, possibly leading to death (1 to 2 in 10 cases are fatal)       Tetanus        Share on Facebook       Share on Twitter       Share on Linkedin       Share on Pinterest 			Share via Email       Print this Page                     Infectious Diseases                      What is tetanus?
Tetanus is a sometimes fatal disease of the central nervous system.
It's caused by a poison (toxin) made by the tetanus bacterium.
The bacterium usually enters the body through an open wound.
Tetanus bacteria live in soil and manure.
They can also be found in the human intestine and other places.
Tetanus occurs more often in warmer climates or during the warmer months.
Tetanus is very uncommon in the U.S. due to widespread immunization.
What causes tetanus?
Tetanus is caused by the toxin of the bacterium clostridium tetani.
It’s not spread from person to person.
It occurs in people who have had a skin or deep tissue wound or puncture.
It’s also seen in the umbilical stump of infants in underdeveloped countries.
This occurs in places where immunization to tetanus is not widespread and where parents may not know how to care for the stump after the baby is born.
After being exposed to tetanus, it may take from 3 to 21 days to develop any symptoms.
In infants, symptoms may take from 3 days to 2 weeks to develop.
What are the symptoms of tetanus?
These are the most common symptoms of tetanus:      Stiff jaw (also called lockjaw)     Stiff abdominal and back muscles     Contraction of the facial muscles     Fast pulse     Fever     Sweating     Painful muscle spasms, especially near the wound area (if these affect the throat or chest wall, breathing may be stopped)     Trouble swallowing  The symptoms of tetanus may look like other medical conditions.
Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is tetanus diagnosed?
Diagnosis is based on a complete history and physical exam.
How is tetanus treated?
Your healthcare provider will determine your specific treatment for tetanus based on:      How old you are     Your overall health and medical history     How sick you are     How well you can handle specific medicines, procedures, or therapies     How long the condition is expected to last     Your opinion or preference  Treatment for tetanus (or to reduce the risk of tetanus after an injury) may include:      Medicines to control spasms     Thorough cleaning of the wound     A course of tetanus antitoxin injections     Use of a ventilator (breathing machine) if you have trouble breathing on your own      Antibiotics     Other medicines to control pain and other symptoms such as fast heartbeat  What are the complications of tetanus?
Complications of tetanus can include:      Vocal cord spasms     Broken bones due to severe muscle spasms     Breathing problems     Pneumonia     High blood pressure or abnormal heart rhythms      Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)  Can tetanus be prevented?
A DTaP shot is a combination vaccine that protects against 3 diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.
The CDC recommends that children receive 5 DTaP shots.
The first 3 shots are given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.
Between 15 and 18 months of age, the fourth shot is given, and a fifth is given when a child enters school at 4 to 6 years of age.
At regular checkups for 11- or 12-year-olds, a preteen should get a dose of Tdap.
The Tdap booster contains tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine.
If an adult did not get a Tdap as a preteen or teen, he or she should get a dose of Tdap instead of the Td booster.
Adults should get a Td booster every 10 years, but it can be given before the 10-year mark.
Always see your healthcare provider for advice.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
If you get a wound from an object that is contaminated with dirt, animal feces, or manure, you should see your healthcare provider for a tetanus booster shot if it has been more than 5 years since your previous vaccination or you can’t remember your last vaccination.
If you have any of the symptoms listed in the symptoms section, seek medical care immediately, as tetanus requires urgent attention.
Key points about tetanus      Tetanus is an acute, sometimes fatal, disease of the central nervous system, caused by the toxin of the bacterium clostridium tetani.
The bacterium clostridium tetani usually enters the body through an open wound.
Tetanus bacteria live in soil and manure.
It can also be found in the human intestine and other places.
Symptoms of tetanus may include stiffness of the jaw, abdominal, and back muscles, fast pulse, fever, sweating, painful muscle spasms and difficulty swallowing.
The tetanus vaccine can reduce the risk of the disease after an injury.
Tetanus requires immediate medical attention and treatment with medications and tetanus antitoxin injections.
Next steps Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:      Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen.
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.
At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests.
Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you.
Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you.
Also know what the side effects are.
Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways.
Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.
Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.
If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.                               	How is tetanus transmitted?
Tetanus isn't contagious.
It occurs in those who have had a skin or deep tissue wound or puncture.
It is also seen in the umbilical stump of infants in underdeveloped countries.
This occurs in places where immunization to tetanus is not widespread and women may not know proper care of the stump after the baby is born.
After being exposed to tetanus, it may take between two days to two months to develop any symptoms.
In infants, symptoms may take between five days to two weeks to develop.
What are the symptoms of tetanus?
The following are the most common symptoms of tetanus.
However, each child may experience symptoms differently.
Symptoms may include:        		stiffness of jaw (also called lockjaw)       		stiffness of abdominal and back muscles       		contraction of facial muscles       		fast pulse       		fever       		sweating       		painful muscle spasms near the wound area (if these affect the larynx or chest wall, they may cause asphyxiation)       		difficulty swallowing    	The symptoms of tetanus may resemble other medical conditions.
Always consult your child's physician for a diagnosis.Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a serious but preventable disease that affects the body's muscles and nerves.It's often referred to as "lockjaw" because it can cause painful spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles.Tetanus is a serious infection that can be life-threatening, and is easily prevented with vaccination.
It is caused by a toxin produced by spores of the bacteria Clostridium tetani.
These bacteria live in the environment, including in soil, dust, and animal feces, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Any time you get a wound that may become contaminated with soil or environmental contents, you are at risk for tetanus.Once the bacteria get into the wound, they can produce a toxin that affects the abilities of muscles to work.
This can cause stiffening and rigidity of muscles, which is a very serious condition, especially once it affects the muscles used to breathe, notes the Mayo Clinic.The disease can lead to serious complications, and even death.
Tetanus is a medical emergency that requires treatment in a hospital.Most cases occur in people who have not been vaccinated.What is tetanus?
— Tetanus is a serious infection that causes muscle stiffness and spasms.
It is sometimes called "lockjaw" because muscle spasms can clench the jaw shut.Tetanus is caused by bacteria (germs) that live in the soil.
They can get into the body through a cut or scrape.
They can also get into the body if a person uses a needle to inject illegal drugs.
Most people in the United States are protected from these bacteria because they have gotten vaccines against them.What are the symptoms of tetanus?
— The symptoms include:●Stiff jaw or neck muscles, which make it hard to move your jaw or neck normally●Strange-looking smile that does not go away when you try to relax your mouth●Tight, painful muscles that do not let go when you try to relax them●Trouble breathing, swallowing, or both●Feeling irritable or restless●Sweating even when you are not exercising or hot●Heartbeat that is faster than usual, or irregular heartbeat●Fever●Painful muscle spasmsPeople who are very sick with tetanus can have muscle spasms that force the body into a "bridge" position.
They might have:●Clenched fists●Back arched off the floor or bed●Legs stretched out●Arms moving back and forth●Trouble breathing – They might even stop breathing during a muscle spasm.Should I see a doctor or nurse?
— See your doctor or nurse right away if:●You get a puncture wound, for example from a nail that goes through your skin.●You get a cut, scrape, or other injury you cannot clean completely.●You have an injury that leaves something (like a nail or glass) inside your body.●An animal bites you.●You have diabetes, and get a sore on your foot, leg, or other place.●You have a stiff jaw or neck, other tight muscles you cannot relax, or painful muscle spasms.●You have trouble breathing or swallowing.It is especially important to see a doctor or nurse if you get a puncture wound or animal bite and your last tetanus shot was 5 years ago or longer, or if you do not remember getting a tetanus shot.Is there a test for tetanus?
— No.
There is no simple test.
But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and vaccine history, and by doing an exam.
This infection is most likely in people who have had an injury and who have not had the tetanus vaccine at all or not had the right vaccine boosters.Is tetanus dangerous?
— Yes.
People with tetanus need to go to the hospital, and some people even die from it.
The muscle spasms can stop your breathing.How is tetanus treated?
— Doctors treat tetanus in the hospital, sometimes in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Treatments include:●Cleaning cuts or scrapes to remove skin and tissue that could have tetanus bacteria on it●Giving medicines to fight the infection●Giving a tetanus vaccine booster●Giving medicine and other treatments to reduce muscle spasms, breathing problems, pain, and other symptoms●Using a ventilator (breathing machine) if you have trouble breathing on your own●Using a feeding tube if you cannot eat or drink on your own●Having physical therapy to help muscles recoverCan tetanus be prevented?
— Yes.
To reduce your chances of getting tetanus, do these things:●Get a tetanus vaccine.
This teaches your body how to fight tetanus.
Most children growing up in the United States get this vaccine as part of their routine childhood vaccines.●Get regular tetanus booster shots.
Adults should get tetanus booster shots every 10 years.
For bad wounds, you will need to get a tetanus booster shot if you haven't had one in the last 5 years.
If you have a bad wound and you haven't received all of your tetanus vaccines or you are not sure if you have, you will need a tetanus booster shot and another shot to fight any tetanus bacteria that got in the wound.●Wash cuts or scrapes with soap and water and use antibiotic ointment on them.
See a doctor or nurse if you cannot get all the dirt out or cannot see all the way into the wound.●Do not inject illegal drugs, or at least use clean needles if you do inject drugs or anything else.More on this topic Patient education: Taking care of cuts and scrapes (The Basics) Patient education: Animal and human bites (The Basics) Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics) Patient education: What you should know about vaccines (The Basics) Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics) Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics) Patient education: Vaccines for adults (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?

The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles.
Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw.
Severe complications of tetanus can be life-threatening.
There's no cure for tetanus.
Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve.
Because of the widespread use of vaccines, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world.
The disease remains a threat to people who aren't up to date on their vaccinations.
It's more common in developing countries.Products & ServicesBook: Mayo Clinic Guide to Raising a Healthy Child                                                                                              SymptomsThe average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days.
The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days.
The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus.
Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks.
They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body.
Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include:      Painful muscle spasms and stiff, immovable muscles (muscle rigidity) in your jaw     Tension of muscles around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin     Painful spasms and rigidity in your neck muscles     Difficulty swallowing     Rigid abdominal muscles  Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms).
Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched.
Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties.
These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light.
As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include:      High blood pressure     Low blood pressure     Rapid heart rate     Fever     Extreme sweating                                    Localized tetanusThis uncommon form of tetanus results in muscles spasms near the site of a wound.
While it's usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus.
Cephalic tetanusThis rare form of tetanus results from a head wound.
It results in weakened muscles in the face and spasms of the jaw muscles.
It also can progress to generalized tetanus.
When to see a doctorTetanus is a life-threatening disease.
If you have signs or symptoms of tetanus, seek emergency care.
If you have a simple, clean wound — and you've had a tetanus shot within 10 years — you can care for your wound at home.
Seek medical care in the following cases:      You've not had a tetanus shot within 10 years.
You are unsure of when you last had a tetanus shot.
You have a puncture wound, a foreign object in your wound, an animal bite or a deep cut.
Your wound is contaminated with dirt, soil, feces, rust or saliva — or you have any doubt about whether you've cleaned a wound sufficiently after such exposure.
Contaminated wounds require a vaccination booster if it's been five or more years since your last tetanus shot.
Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic                                                      CausesThe bacterium that causes tetanus is called Clostridium tetani.
The bacterium can survive in a dormant state in soil and animal feces.
It's essentially shut down until it discovers a place to thrive.
When the dormant bacteria enter a wound — a condition good for growth — the cells are "awakened."
As they are growing and dividing, they release a toxin called tetanospasmin.
The toxin impairs the nerves in the body that control muscles.
Risk factorsThe greatest risk factor for tetanus infection is not being vaccinated or not keeping up with the 10-year booster shots.
Other factors that increase the risk of tetanus infection are:      Cuts or wounds exposed to soil or manure     A foreign body in a wound, such as a nail or splinter     A history of immune-suppressing medical conditions     Infected skin lesions in people living with diabetes     An infected umbilical cord when a mother isn't fully vaccinated     Shared and unsanitary needles for illegal drug use                                    ComplicationsComplications of tetanus infection may include:      Breathing problems.
Life-threatening breathing problems can occur from tightening of the vocal cords and muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen, especially during a generalized spasm.
Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism).
A blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches.
Pneumonia.
A lung infection caused by accidentally inhaling something into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia) may be a complication of generalized spasms.
Broken bones.
Generalized spasms may cause fractures of the spine or other bones.
Death.
Death from tetanus is often caused by a blocked airway during spasms or damage to the nerves that regulate breathing, heart rate or other organ functions.
PreventionYou can prevent tetanus by being vaccinated.
Vaccination for childrenThe tetanus vaccine is given to children as part of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP).
Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection of the nose and throat.
Acellular pertussis, also called whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory infection.
Children who do not tolerate the pertussis vaccine may receive the alternative vaccine called DT.
The DTaP is a series of five shots typically given in the arm or thigh to children at ages:      2 months     4 months     6 months     15 to 18 months     4 to 6 years                                    Vaccination for children ages 7 to 18A booster shot is recommended for children at age 11 or 12.
This booster is called the Tdap vaccine.
If your child didn't get a booster shot as this age, talk to your doctor about appropriate options.
Vaccination for adults age 19 and olderA booster shot is recommended for adults once every 10 years.
This may be one of two vaccines, Tdap or Td.
If you weren't vaccinated against tetanus as a child or are unsure about your vaccination status, see your doctor about getting the Tdap vaccine.
Vaccination during pregnancyA booster is recommended during the third trimester of a pregnancy, regardless of the mother's vaccination schedule.
Other recommendations     Ask your doctor to review your vaccination status regularly.
Check whether you are current on your vaccination schedule if you are planning international travel.

[1] In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body.
[1] Each spasm usually lasts a few minutes.
[1] Spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks.
[1] Some spasms may be severe enough to fracture bones.
[6] Other symptoms of tetanus may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate.
[1][6] Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection.
[1] Recovery may take months.
[1] About ten percent of cases prove to be fatal.
[1] Tetanus is caused by an infection with the bacterium Clostridium tetani,[1] which is commonly found in soil, saliva, dust, and manure.
[2] The bacteria generally enter through a break in the skin such as a cut or puncture wound by a contaminated object.
[2] They produce toxins that interfere with normal muscle contractions.
[3] Diagnosis is based on the presenting signs and symptoms.
[1] The disease does not spread between people.
[1] Tetanus can be prevented by immunization with the tetanus vaccine.
[1] In those who have a significant wound and have had fewer than three doses of the vaccine, both vaccination and tetanus immune globulin are recommended.
[1] The wound should be cleaned and any dead tissue should be removed.
[1] In those who are infected, tetanus immune globulin or, if unavailable, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used.
[1] Muscle relaxants may be used to control spasms.
[3] Mechanical ventilation may be required if a person's breathing is affected.
[3] Tetanus occurs in all parts of the world but is most frequent in hot and wet climates where the soil has a high organic content.
[1] In 2015 there were about 209,000 infections and about 59,000 deaths globally.
[4][5] This is down from 356,000 deaths in 1990.
[7] In the US there are about 30 cases per year, almost all of which have not been vaccinated.
[8] An early description of the disease was made by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC.
[1] The cause of the disease was determined in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone at the University of Turin, and a vaccine was developed in 1924.

The spasms can also affect the facial muscles resulting in an appearance called risus sardonicus.
Chest, neck, back, abdominal muscles and buttocks may be affected.
Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called opisthotonos.
Sometimes the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing, which can lead to breathing problems.
[9] Prolonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups, which is called "tetany".
These episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears.
Other symptoms include fever, headache, restlessness, irritability, feeding difficulties, breathing problems, burning sensation during urination, urinary retention and loss of stool control.
[10] Even with treatment, about 10% of people who contract tetanus die.
[1] The mortality rate is higher in unvaccinated people and people over 60 years of age.
[1]  Incubation period[edit] The incubation period of tetanus may be up to several months, but is usually about ten days.
[11][12] In general, the farther the injury site is from the central nervous system, the longer the incubation period.
The shorter the incubation period, the more severe the symptoms.
[13] In trismus nascentium (i.e.
neonatal tetanus), symptoms usually appear from 4 to 14 days after birth, averaging about 7 days.
On the basis of clinical findings, four different forms of tetanus have been described.
[1]  Generalized tetanus[edit] Generalized tetanus is the most common type of tetanus, representing about 80% of cases.
The generalized form usually presents with a descending pattern.
The first sign is trismus or lockjaw, and the facial spasms are called risus sardonicus, followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, and rigidity of pectoral and calf muscles.
Other symptoms include elevated temperature, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and episodic rapid heart rate.
Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes with the body shaped into a characteristic form called opisthotonos.
Spasms continue for up to four weeks, and complete recovery may take months.
[1]  Neonatal tetanus[edit] Main article: Neonatal tetanus Neonatal tetanus (trismus nascentium) is a form of generalized tetanus that occurs in newborns, usually those born to mothers who themselves have not been vaccinated.
If the mother has been vaccinated against tetanus, the infants acquire passive immunity and are thus protected.
[14] It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument.
As of 1998 neonatal tetanus was common in many developing countries and was responsible for about 14% (215,000) of all neonatal deaths.
[15] In 2010 the worldwide death toll was 58,000 newborns.
As the result of a public health campaign, the death toll from neonatal tetanus was reduced by 90% between 1990 and 2010, and by 2013 the disease had been largely eliminated from all but 25 countries.
[16] Neonatal tetanus is rare in developed countries.
Local tetanus[edit] Local tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease, in which people have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury.
The contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding.
Local tetanus is generally milder; only about 1% of cases are fatal, but it may precede the onset of generalized tetanus.
[1]  Cephalic tetanus[edit] Cephalic tetanus is the rarest form of the disease (0.9–3% of cases)[17] and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head.
[18] It usually occurs after trauma to the head area, including skull fracture,[19] laceration,[19] eye injury,[18] dental extraction,[20] and otitis media,[21] but it has been observed from injuries to other parts of the body.
[22] Paralysis of the facial nerve is most frequently implicated, which may cause lockjaw, facial palsy, or ptosis, but other cranial nerves can also be affected.
[20][23] Cephalic tetanus may progress to a more generalized form of the disease.
[17][23] Due to its rarity, clinicians may be unfamiliar with the clinical presentation and may not suspect tetanus as the illness.
[18] Treatment can be complicated as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection.
[19] Cephalic tetanus is more likely than other forms of tetanus to be fatal, with the progression to generalized tetanus carrying a 15–30% case fatality rate.
[17][19][23]  Cause[edit]   Clostridium tetani is durable due to its endospores.
Pictured is the bacterium alone, with a spore being produced, and the spore alone.
Tetanus is caused by the tetanus bacterium Clostridium tetani.
[1] Tetanus is an international health problem, as C. tetani endospores are ubiquitous.
Endospores can be introduced into the body through a puncture wound (penetrating trauma).
Due to C. tetani being an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen, such as a puncture wound.
With the changes in oxygen levels, the drum stick-shaped endospore can result in quick spread.
[24] The disease occurs almost exclusively in persons inadequately immunized.
[25] It is more common in hot, damp climates with soil rich in organic matter.
Manure-treated soils may contain spores, as they are widely distributed in the intestines and feces of many animals such as horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens.
[1] In agricultural areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism.
[26] The spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated heroin.
[1] Heroin users, particularly those who inject the drug subcutaneously, appear to be at high risk of contracting tetanus.
[1] Rarely, tetanus can be contracted through surgical procedures, intramuscular injections, compound fractures, and dental infections.
[1] Animal bites can transmit tetanus.
[1] Tetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails.
Although rust itself does not cause tetanus, objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbor anaerobic bacteria.
Additionally, the rough surface of rusty metal provides crevices for dirt containing C. tetani, while a nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound.
[27] An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment.
Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment may exist under the skin, and the puncturing object can deliver endospores to a suitable environment for growth.
[28] It is a common misconception that rust itself is the cause and that a puncture from a rust-free nail is not a risk.
[29][30]  Pathophysiology[edit]   A neurotransmitter-filled vesicle before and after exposure to the tetanus toxin.
The cleavage of the VAMP protein by the toxin inhibits vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release into the synapse.
Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) binds to the presynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, is internalized and is transported back through the axon until it reaches the central nervous system.
[31] Here, it selectively binds to and is transported into inhibitory neurons via endocytosis.
[32] It then leaves the vesicle for the neuron cytosol where it cleaves vesicle associated membrane protein (VAMP) synaptobrevin, which is necessary for membrane fusion of small synaptic vesicles (SSV's).
[31] SSV's carry neurotransmitter to the membrane for release, so inhibition of this process blocks neurotransmitter release.
[citation needed] Tetanus toxin specifically blocks the release of the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine from inhibitory neurons.
These neurotransmitters keep overactive motor neurons from firing and also play a role in the relaxation of muscles after contraction.
When inhibitory neurons are unable to release their neurotransmitters, motor neurons fire out of control and muscles have difficulty relaxing.
This causes the muscle spasms and spastic paralysis seen in tetanus infection.
[31] The tetanus toxin, tetanospasmin, is made up of a heavy chain and a light chain.
There are three domains, each of which contributes to the pathophysiology of the toxin.
[33] The heavy chain has two of the domains.
The N-terminal side of the heavy chain helps with membrane translocation, and the C-terminal side helps the toxin locate the specific receptor site on the correct neuron.
The light chain domain cleaves the VAMP protein once it arrives in the inhibitory neuron cytosol.
[33] There are four main steps in tetanus's mechanism of action: binding to the neuron, internalization of the toxin, membrane translocation, and cleavage of the target VAMP.
[citation needed]  Neurospecific binding[edit] The toxin travels from the wound site to the neuromuscular junction through the bloodstream where it binds to the presynaptic membrane of a motor neuron.
The heavy chain C-terminal domain aids in the binding to the correct site, recognizing and binding to the correct glycoproteins and glycolipids in the presynaptic membrane.
The toxin binds to a site that will be taken into the neuron as an endocytic vesicle that will travel down the axon, past the cell body, and down the dendrites to the dendritic terminal at the spine and central nervous system.
Here it will be released into the synaptic cleft and allowed to bind with the presynaptic membrane of inhibitory neurons in a similar manner seen with the binding to the motor neuron.
[32]  Internalization[edit] Tetanus toxin is then internalized again via endocytosis, this time in an acidic vesicle.
[33] In a mechanism not well understood, depolarization caused by the firing of the inhibitory neuron causes the toxin to be pulled into the neuron inside vesicles.
[citation needed]  Membrane translocation[edit] The toxin then needs a way to get out of the vesicle and into the neuron cytosol for it to act on its target.
The low pH of the vesicle lumen causes a conformational change in the toxin, shifting it from a water-soluble form to a hydrophobic form.
[32] With the hydrophobic patches exposed, the toxin can slide into the vesicle membrane.
The toxin forms an ion channel in the membrane that is nonspecific for Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− ions.
[31] There is a consensus among experts that this new channel is involved in the translocation of the toxin's light chain from the inside of the vesicle to the neuron cytosol, but the mechanism is not well understood or agreed upon.
It has been proposed that the channel could allow the light chain (unfolded from the low pH environment) to leave through the toxin pore,[34] or that the pore could alter the electrochemical gradient enough, by letting in or out ions, to cause osmotic lysis of the vesicle, spilling the vesicle's contents.
[35]  Enzymatic target cleavage[edit] The light chain of the tetanus toxin is zinc-dependent protease.
It shares a common zinc protease motif (His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His) that researchers hypothesized was essential for target cleavage until this was more recently confirmed by experiment: when all zinc was removed from the neuron with heavy metal chelators, the toxin was inhibited, only to be reactivated when the zinc was added back in.
[31] The light chain binds to VAMP and cleaves it between Gln76 and Phe77.
Without VAMP, vesicles holding the neurotransmitters needed for motor neuron regulation (GABA and glycine) cannot be released, causing the above-mentioned deregulation of motor neurons and muscle tension.
[36]  Diagnosis[edit] There are currently no blood tests for diagnosing tetanus.
The diagnosis is based on the presentation of tetanus symptoms and does not depend upon isolation of the bacterium, which is recovered from the wound in only 30% of cases and can be isolated from people without tetanus.
Laboratory identification of C. tetani can be demonstrated only by production of tetanospasmin in mice.
[1] Having recently experienced head trauma may indicate cephalic tetanus if no other diagnosis has been made.
[citation needed] The "spatula test" is a clinical test for tetanus that involves touching the posterior pharyngeal wall with a soft-tipped instrument and observing the effect.
A positive test result is the involuntary contraction of the jaw (biting down on the "spatula") and a negative test result would normally be a gag reflex attempting to expel the foreign object.
A short report in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene states that, in an affected subject research study, the spatula test had a high specificity (zero false-positive test results) and a high sensitivity (94% of infected people produced a positive test).
[37]  Prevention[edit] Unlike many infectious diseases, recovery from naturally acquired tetanus does not usually result in immunity to tetanus.
This is due to the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin.
Tetanospasmin will likely be lethal before it will provoke an immune response.
[citation needed] Tetanus can be prevented by vaccination with tetanus toxoid.
[38] The CDC recommends that adults receive a booster vaccine every ten years,[1] and standard care practice in many places is to give the booster to any person with a puncture wound who is uncertain of when he or she was last vaccinated, or if he or she has had fewer than three lifetime doses of the vaccine.
The booster may not prevent a potentially fatal case of tetanus from the current wound, however, as it can take up to two weeks for tetanus antibodies to form.
[39] In children under the age of seven, the tetanus vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, DPT/DTaP vaccine, which also includes vaccines against diphtheria and pertussis.
For adults and children over seven, the Td vaccine (tetanus and diphtheria) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) is commonly used.
[38] The World Health Organization certifies countries as having eliminated maternal or neonatal tetanus.
Certification requires at least two years of rates of less than 1 case per 1,000 live births.
In 1998 in Uganda, 3,433 tetanus cases were recorded in newborn babies; of these, 2,403 died.
After a major public health effort, Uganda in 2011 was certified as having eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus.
[40]  Post-exposure prophylaxis[edit] Tetanus toxoid can be given in case of suspected exposure to tetanus.
In such cases, it can be given with or without tetanus immunoglobulin (also called tetanus antibodies or tetanus antitoxin[41]).
It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.
The guidelines for such events in the United States for non-pregnant people 11 years and older are as follows:[1]    Vaccination status Clean, minor wounds All other wounds   Unknown or less than 3 doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine Tdap and recommend catch-up vaccination Tdap and recommend catch-up vaccination Tetanus immunoglobulin   3 or more doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine AND less than 5 years since the last dose  No indication No indication   3 or more doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine AND 5–10 years since the last dose  No indication Tdap preferred (if not yet received) or Td   3 or more doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine AND more than 10 years since the last dose  Tdap preferred (if not yet received) or Td Tdap preferred (if not yet received) or Td  Treatment[edit]   Tetanus deaths per million persons in 2012.mw-parser-output .refbegin{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul{margin-left:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul>li{margin-left:0;padding-left:3.2em;text-indent:-3.2em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents ul,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents ul li{list-style:none}@media(max-width:720px){.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indents>ul>li{padding-left:1.6em;text-indent:-1.6em}}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns ul{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .refbegin-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .legend-color{display:inline-block;min-width:1.25em;height:1.25em;line-height:1.25;margin:1px 0;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:transparent;color:black}.mw-parser-output .legend-text{}  0–1  1–2  2–3  4–8  9–13  14–28  29–151 Mild tetanus[edit] Mild cases of tetanus can be treated with:[42]  Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG),[1] also called tetanus antibodies or tetanus antitoxin.
[41] It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.
Antibiotic therapy to reduce toxin production.
Metronidazole intravenous (IV) is a preferred treatment.
[42] Benzodiazepines can be used to control muscle spasms.
Options include diazepam and lorazepam, oral or IV.
[42] Severe tetanus[edit] Severe cases will require admission to intensive care.
In addition to the measures listed above for mild tetanus:[42]  Human tetanus immunoglobulin injected intrathecally (which increases clinical improvement from 4% to 35%) Tracheotomy and mechanical ventilation for 3 to 4 weeks.
Tracheotomy is recommended for securing the airway because the presence of an endotracheal tube is a stimulus for spasm Magnesium sulfate, as an intravenous infusion, to control spasm and autonomic dysfunction Diazepam as a continuous IV infusion The autonomic effects of tetanus can be difficult to manage (alternating hyper- and hypotension hyperpyrexia/hypothermia) and may require IV labetalol, magnesium, clonidine, or nifedipine Drugs such as diazepam or other muscle relaxants can be given to control the muscle spasms.
In extreme cases it may be necessary to paralyze the person with curare-like drugs and use a mechanical ventilator.
To survive a tetanus infection, the maintenance of an airway and proper nutrition are required.
An intake of 3,500 to 4,000 calories and at least 150 g of protein per day is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), or through a drip into a vein (parenteral nutrition).
This high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain brought on by the increased muscle activity.
Full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve axon terminals.
[citation needed] The antibiotic of choice is metronidazole.
It can be given as intravenously, by mouth, or by rectum.
[43][42] Of likewise efficiency is penicillin, but some raise the concern of provoking spasms because it inhibits GABA receptor, which is already affected by tetanospasmin.

[7] Tetanus – in particular, the neonatal form – remains a significant public health problem in non-industrialized countries with 59,000 newborns worldwide dying in 2008 as a result of neonatal tetanus.
[45][46] In the United States, from 2000 through 2007 an average of 31 cases were reported per year.
[1] Nearly all of the cases in the United States occur in unimmunized individuals or individuals who have allowed their inoculations to lapse.
[1]   		 			 			 Tetanus cases reported worldwide (1990-2004).
Ranging from some (in dark red) to very few (in light yellow) (grey, no data).
Tetanus deaths between 1990 and 2017 by age group[47]  			 		  History[edit] Tetanus was well known to ancient communities and civilizations who recognized the relationship between wounds and fatal muscle spasms.
[48] In 1884, Arthur Nicolaier isolated the strychnine-like toxin of tetanus from free-living, anaerobic soil bacteria.
The etiology of the disease was further elucidated in 1884 by Antonio Carle and Giorgio Rattone, two pathologists of the University of Turin, who demonstrated the transmissibility of tetanus for the first time.
They produced tetanus in rabbits by injecting pus from a person with fatal tetanus into their sciatic nerves and testing their reactions while tetanus was spreading.
[1] In 1891, C. tetani was isolated from a human victim by Kitasato Shibasaburō, who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies.
In 1897, Edmond Nocard showed that tetanus antitoxin induced passive immunity in humans, and could be used for prophylaxis and treatment.
Tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed by P. Descombey in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during World War II.
[1]  Etymology[edit] The word tetanus comes from the Ancient Greek: τέτανος, romanized: tetanos, lit.
'taut', which is further from the Ancient Greek: τείνειν, romanized: teinein, lit.
'to stretch'.
[49]  Research[edit] There is insufficient evidence to recommending treating or preventing tetanus with vitamin C.[50]  See also[edit] Renshaw cell Tetanized state Tetanospasmin  References[edit] .mw-parser-output .reflist{font-size:90%;margin-bottom:0.5em;list-style-type:decimal}.mw-parser-output .reflist .references{font-size:100%;margin-bottom:0;list-style-type:inherit}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-2{column-width:30em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns-3{column-width:25em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns{margin-top:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns ol{margin-top:0}.mw-parser-output .reflist-columns li{page-break-inside:avoid;break-inside:avoid-column}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-alpha{list-style-type:upper-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-upper-roman{list-style-type:upper-roman}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-alpha{list-style-type:lower-alpha}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-greek{list-style-type:lower-greek}.mw-parser-output .reflist-lower-roman{list-style-type:lower-roman}  ^ Jump up to: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj ak al am an ao ap aq ar as .mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:"\"""\"""'""'"}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration{color:#555}.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration span{border-bottom:1px dotted;cursor:help}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:linear-gradient(transparent,transparent),url("//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}.mw-parser-output code.cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{font-size:100%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#33aa33;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}Atkinson, William (May 2012).

The number is low because an effective tetanus vaccine is given as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.Most people who get tetanus have either not been vaccinated against it or did not complete the entire vaccination schedule.
How you get tetanus                                      Tetanus bacteria can survive for a long time outside the body and are commonly found in soil and the manure of animals such as horses and cows.If the bacteria enter the body through a wound they can quickly multiply and release a toxin that affects the nerves, causing symptoms such as muscle stiffness and spasms.The bacteria can get into your body through:cuts and grazestears or splits in the skinburnsanimal bitesbody piercings, tattoos and injectionseye injuriesinjecting contaminated drugsTetanus cannot be spread from person to person.
Symptoms of tetanus                                      The symptoms of tetanus usually start around 4 to 21 days after infection.
On average, they start after around 10 days.The main symptoms of tetanus include:stiffness in your jaw muscles (lockjaw), which can make it difficult to open your mouthpainful muscle spasms, which can make it difficult to breathe and swallowa high temperaturesweatinga rapid heartbeatIf it's not treated, the symptoms can get worse over the following hours and days.
When to get medical advice                                      Contact a GP or visit your nearest minor injuries unit if you're concerned about a wound, particularly if:it's a deep woundthere's dirt or something inside the woundyou have not been fully vaccinated for tetanus, or you're not sure if you haveA doctor will assess the wound and decide whether you need treatment and whether you need to go to hospital.Go to your nearest A&E immediately, or call 999 for an ambulance, if you get severe muscle stiffness or spasms.
How tetanus is treated                                      If a doctor thinks there's a chance you could develop tetanus from a wound, but you do not yet have any symptoms, they'll make sure your wound is thoroughly cleaned.
They may also give you an injection of tetanus immunoglobulin.If you have not been fully immunised for tetanus, or you're not sure whether you have, you may be given a dose of the tetanus vaccine.
You may also be given antibiotics.Tetanus immunoglobulin is a medicine containing antibodies that prevent the tetanus toxin working, stopping its effects on the nerves.
It provides immediate, but short-term, protection from tetanus.If you develop symptoms of tetanus, you'll usually need to be admitted to a hospital intensive care unit (ICU), where you may be given several different treatments.
These could include tetanus immunoglobulin, antibiotics, and medicine to help muscle stiffness and spasms.Most people who develop symptoms of tetanus do recover, but it can take several weeks or months.
Tetanus vaccination                                      The tetanus vaccine is given as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.The full course of vaccination includes 5 injections, usually given on the following schedule:the first 3 doses are given as part of the 6-in-1 vaccine at age 8, 12 and 16 weeksa booster dose is given as part of the 4-in-1 pre-school booster at age 3 years and 4 monthsa final dose is given as part of the 3-in-1 teenage booster at age 14This course of 5 injections should provide long-lasting protection against tetanus.
However, if you or your child has a deep or dirty wound, it's best to get medical advice.If you're not sure whether you've had the full vaccination course, contact your GP surgery for advice.
It's possible to fully vaccinate older children and adults who were not vaccinated when they were younger.
Tetanus travel jab                                      Tetanus is found throughout the world, so you should make sure you're fully vaccinated before travelling abroad.Contact your GP surgery for advice if you're planning to travel abroad and have not been fully vaccinated against tetanus, or you're going to an area with limited medical facilities and your last vaccine dose was more than 10 years ago.You'll be offered the 3-in-1 teenage booster.
This injection, which also protects against diphtheria and polio, is usually free on the NHS.If you've never had the tetanus vaccine before, you may be advised to have as many doses as possible before you travel.
There should be a 1-month gap between each dose.
If there's not enough time to have all the doses you need, you can complete the course when you return.Read more about travel vaccinations.

Tetanus infection can lead to serious health problems, including being unable to open the mouth and having trouble swallowing and breathing.
Symptoms Symptoms of tetanus include:     The first sign is most commonly spasms of the muscles of the jaw, or “lockjaw.”     Jaw cramping Sudden, involuntary muscle tightening (muscle spasms) — often in the stomach Painful muscle stiffness all over the body Trouble swallowing Jerking or staring (seizures) Headache Fever and sweating Changes in blood pressure and heart rate   Complications Serious health problems that can happen because of tetanus include:  Uncontrolled/involuntary tightening of the vocal cords (laryngospasm) Broken bones (fractures) Infections gotten by a patient during a hospital visit (hospital-acquired infections) Blockage of the main artery of the lung or one of its branches by a blood clot that has travelled from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (pulmonary embolism) Pneumonia, a lung infection, that develops by breathing in foreign materials (aspiration pneumonia) Breathing difficulty, possibly leading to death (1 to 2 in 10 cases are fatal)       Tetanus        Share on Facebook       Share on Twitter       Share on Linkedin       Share on Pinterest 			Share via Email       Print this Page                     Infectious Diseases                      What is tetanus?
Tetanus is a sometimes fatal disease of the central nervous system.
It's caused by a poison (toxin) made by the tetanus bacterium.
The bacterium usually enters the body through an open wound.
Tetanus bacteria live in soil and manure.
They can also be found in the human intestine and other places.
Tetanus occurs more often in warmer climates or during the warmer months.
Tetanus is very uncommon in the U.S. due to widespread immunization.
What causes tetanus?
Tetanus is caused by the toxin of the bacterium clostridium tetani.
It’s not spread from person to person.
It occurs in people who have had a skin or deep tissue wound or puncture.
It’s also seen in the umbilical stump of infants in underdeveloped countries.
This occurs in places where immunization to tetanus is not widespread and where parents may not know how to care for the stump after the baby is born.
After being exposed to tetanus, it may take from 3 to 21 days to develop any symptoms.
In infants, symptoms may take from 3 days to 2 weeks to develop.
What are the symptoms of tetanus?
These are the most common symptoms of tetanus:      Stiff jaw (also called lockjaw)     Stiff abdominal and back muscles     Contraction of the facial muscles     Fast pulse     Fever     Sweating     Painful muscle spasms, especially near the wound area (if these affect the throat or chest wall, breathing may be stopped)     Trouble swallowing  The symptoms of tetanus may look like other medical conditions.
Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is tetanus diagnosed?
Diagnosis is based on a complete history and physical exam.
How is tetanus treated?
Your healthcare provider will determine your specific treatment for tetanus based on:      How old you are     Your overall health and medical history     How sick you are     How well you can handle specific medicines, procedures, or therapies     How long the condition is expected to last     Your opinion or preference  Treatment for tetanus (or to reduce the risk of tetanus after an injury) may include:      Medicines to control spasms     Thorough cleaning of the wound     A course of tetanus antitoxin injections     Use of a ventilator (breathing machine) if you have trouble breathing on your own      Antibiotics     Other medicines to control pain and other symptoms such as fast heartbeat  What are the complications of tetanus?
Complications of tetanus can include:      Vocal cord spasms     Broken bones due to severe muscle spasms     Breathing problems     Pneumonia     High blood pressure or abnormal heart rhythms      Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lung)  Can tetanus be prevented?
A DTaP shot is a combination vaccine that protects against 3 diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.
The CDC recommends that children receive 5 DTaP shots.
The first 3 shots are given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.
Between 15 and 18 months of age, the fourth shot is given, and a fifth is given when a child enters school at 4 to 6 years of age.
At regular checkups for 11- or 12-year-olds, a preteen should get a dose of Tdap.
The Tdap booster contains tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine.
If an adult did not get a Tdap as a preteen or teen, he or she should get a dose of Tdap instead of the Td booster.
Adults should get a Td booster every 10 years, but it can be given before the 10-year mark.
Always see your healthcare provider for advice.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
If you get a wound from an object that is contaminated with dirt, animal feces, or manure, you should see your healthcare provider for a tetanus booster shot if it has been more than 5 years since your previous vaccination or you can’t remember your last vaccination.
If you have any of the symptoms listed in the symptoms section, seek medical care immediately, as tetanus requires urgent attention.
Key points about tetanus      Tetanus is an acute, sometimes fatal, disease of the central nervous system, caused by the toxin of the bacterium clostridium tetani.
The bacterium clostridium tetani usually enters the body through an open wound.
Tetanus bacteria live in soil and manure.
It can also be found in the human intestine and other places.
Symptoms of tetanus may include stiffness of the jaw, abdominal, and back muscles, fast pulse, fever, sweating, painful muscle spasms and difficulty swallowing.
The tetanus vaccine can reduce the risk of the disease after an injury.
Tetanus requires immediate medical attention and treatment with medications and tetanus antitoxin injections.
Next steps Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:      Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen.
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.
At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests.
Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you.
Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you.
Also know what the side effects are.
Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways.
Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.
Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.
If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a serious but preventable disease that affects the body's muscles and nerves.It's often referred to as "lockjaw" because it can cause painful spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles.Tetanus is a serious infection that can be life-threatening, and is easily prevented with vaccination.
It is caused by a toxin produced by spores of the bacteria Clostridium tetani.
These bacteria live in the environment, including in soil, dust, and animal feces, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Any time you get a wound that may become contaminated with soil or environmental contents, you are at risk for tetanus.Once the bacteria get into the wound, they can produce a toxin that affects the abilities of muscles to work.
This can cause stiffening and rigidity of muscles, which is a very serious condition, especially once it affects the muscles used to breathe, notes the Mayo Clinic.The disease can lead to serious complications, and even death.
Tetanus is a medical emergency that requires treatment in a hospital.Most cases occur in people who have not been vaccinated.
