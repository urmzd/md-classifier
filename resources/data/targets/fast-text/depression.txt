    What Is Moderate Depression?
While everyone feels down from time to time, depression is a serious mental health condition that can make it difficult to function normally.
But depression can vary in intensity.
How depression is experienced can vary from one person to the next, and the condition can also be classified as either mild, moderate, or severe.
One survey found that among U.S. adults with depression, approximately 20% had mild symptoms, 50% had moderate symptoms, and 30% had severe symptoms.1           Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States.
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 19.4 million (or 7.8%) of American adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2019.2   When a major depressive disorder is diagnosed, it is typically classified by the degree of severity (mild, moderate, or severe) as well as whether or not there are psychotic features or a seasonal pattern.
Moderately severe depression is marked by symptoms of depression that can affect a person’s ability to function normally.
It may differ from mild depression in terms of severity and frequency of symptoms that a person experiences.
Someone with moderate depression may experience symptoms that are more serious in terms of severity and duration than someone with mild depression.
They may also experience more symptoms than a person with mild depression does.
However, moderate depression is not listed as a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).
There is no official consensus on whether the number of symptoms is indicative of severity or whether the number of symptoms can be used to classify depression as mild, moderate, or severe.
Descriptions of depression severity are left to the discretion of the clinician, who may use depression rating scales to help determine the severity of the condition.
A Verywell Report: Americans Find Strength in Online Therapy            Symptoms    Moderately severe depression is marked by two main symptoms: persistent low mood and decreased interest in activities.
Some of the other symptoms of depression include:3          Avoiding social activities Changes in appetite Decreased productivity Despair and guilt Difficulty concentrating Difficulty sleeping Excessive worry Fatigue or lack of energy Feelings of hopelessness Irritability Lack of motivation Low self-esteem          Women are almost twice as likely to experience depression as men.
While moderate depression may be less severe, it does cause impairments in work, school, home, or social difficulties.4    Research also suggests that moderately severe depression increases certain health risks.
One study found that people who were moderately depressed had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those who were severely depressed.5    How Many People Are Actually Affected by Depression Every Year?
Diagnosis    In order to diagnose your condition, your doctor may perform a physical exam, ask questions about your medical history, and conduct lab tests to help rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be causing or contributing to your symptoms.
Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, is one condition that can lead to symptoms of depression, for example.
Your doctor will also ask questions about the symptoms that you have been experiencing including the type of symptoms you have, how long you have had them, and the degree to which they impact your life in different areas.
In some cases, your doctor may have you fill out a questionnaire to help screen you for depression.
The diagnosis of depression depends on the clinical judgment of a doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist.
Doctors and mental health professionals use the DSM-5 to help guide these diagnostic decisions.
The DSM-5 is published by the American Psychiatric Association and outlines diagnostic criteria for mental health conditions, including depression.
In order to be diagnosed with clinical depression, a person must exhibit at least five of the nine symptoms listed in the DSM-5 during a two-week period.
These symptoms of depression are:    Feeling depressed or irritable most of the day, every dayLosing interest or pleasure in activities most of the daySleep difficulties, including sleeping too much or too littleChanges in motor activityLow energy or fatigueChanges in weightFeelings of worthlessnessDifficulty concentratingSuicidal thoughts or behaviors     Moderately severe depression is generally marked by low mood and irritability most days as well as a loss of interest or enjoyment in activities that were previously pleasurable.
Such symptoms may vary in intensity and duration in someone with moderate depression.
They may experience some of these symptoms some weeks, but not others.
Where people with mild depression may be able to carry out their normal daily activities without much impairment, the symptoms of moderate depression are serious enough to create problems with work and home life.
People with moderately severe depression may struggle to complete daily tasks or feel fatigued and unmotivated.
At work, they may struggle to concentrate on projects.
Symptoms can also lead to problems in social relationships as well.

Follow Now: Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / RSS     Differential Diagnosis    Your doctor will also want to rule out other mental health conditions that can cause symptoms of depression.
Such conditions include:    Persistent depressive disorders (dysthymia): This type of depression is less severe than major depression but tends to be longer-lasting.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): This condition involves symptoms of depression that are experienced the week before and during a menstrual cycle.
Bipolar disorders: Bipolar I and II are marked by mood swings that include periods of depression.
Distinguishing Between Moderate and Severe Depression    While there is no clear consensus on how to rate the severity of depression, one study found that DSM-5 diagnostic criteria could be used to infer the severity of the condition.6      Depressed mood along with the presence of somatic symptoms was an indicator of moderate depression.
People with moderate depression are more likely to experience primary symptoms of low mood, sleep difficulties, weight or appetite changes, and increased/slowed psychomotor activity.
Anhedonia (the loss of interest or pleasure) along with non-somatic symptoms was an indicator of severe depression.
Along with losing interest in things that used to be pleasurable, people with severe depression are more likely to experience symptoms such as feelings of worthlessness and thoughts of death.
Causes    Depression is very common.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is the leading cause of ill health and disability globally.7    There is no single thing that causes depression.
In reality, there are a number of factors that are thought to contribute to the onset of depression.
Sex is one factor that can play a role since women experience depression at about twice the rate of men.
Other things that can contribute to depression include:    GeneticsHaving parents or other family members with depressionHaving another mental health conditionPovertyChronic health conditionsCertain medications    How Cognitive Distortions Fuel Depression      Treatments    Moderately severe depression may be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.
Psychotherapy    Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of therapy that is often used to treat depression.
CBT focuses on identifying negative thoughts that contribute to symptoms of depression.
Once these thought patterns have been identified, people then work to replace those thoughts with more positive and realistic ways of thinking.
CBT tends to be a shorter-term approach to therapy, so it may involve somewhere between 10 and 20 sessions.
During this time, you will also be expected to do homework outside of your therapy sessions.
This might involve practicing skills that you have learned during therapy as well as keeping a record of your symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors.
Examples of types of thinking that can contribute to symptoms of moderate depression include:    Overgeneralization, which involves applying one experience to all future experiences.
Automatic negative thoughts, which are types of thoughts that are self-defeating and irrational.
All-or-nothing thinking, which involves thinking of things in absolute terms.
This type of thinking causes people to see themselves in terms of extremes, either as successes or failures with no room for anything in between.
Ignoring or discounting positive experiences, which involves only focusing on the negative things that happen while not paying attention to the good things.
Magnifying problems, which can involve blowing up even small problems into much more serious issues than they really are.
Taking things personally, which can lead to feelings of blame, regret, or resentment.
Through journaling, you can begin to become more aware of these thought patterns and practice new ways of thinking about your experiences and problems.
It can also help you replace negative self-talk with more positive self-talk.
Other types of therapy that can be used to treat moderately severe depression include:    Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): This approach is a form of CBT that focuses on helping people with depression learn to tolerate distress, regulate their emotions, and improve their relationships with others.
Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This approach focuses on understanding how relationships with others can impact depression.
People then work to improve these social relationships and resolve existing conflicts.Psychodynamic therapy: This form of talk therapy, sometimes known as psychoanalytic therapy, focuses on helping people identify unconscious and unresolved conflicts that lead to troubling feelings.
Online therapy may also be a good option for some people with moderately severe depression.
One study found that guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) was effective for reducing symptoms of mild to moderate depression.8   How to Choose the Best Type of Therapy to Treat Your Depression     Medications    There are a number of different types of antidepressants that can be used to treat moderately severe depression.
The most commonly prescribed are known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
These include medications like Zoloft (sertraline), Prozac (fluoxetine), and Paxil (paroxetine).
While SSRIs are usually the preferred choice because they tend to have fewer side effects, other medications are sometimes prescribed.
Other types of antidepressants include serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), atypical antidepressants, and tricyclic antidepressants.
All antidepressants carry a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black box warning that their use may cause worsening symptoms and increased suicidal ideation in children, teens, and young adults under the age of 25.
Complementary and Alternative Treatments    There are some alternative remedies that may be helpful for some people who have mild to moderate depression.
St. John's wort, for example, is one herbal supplement that is sometimes used to help alleviate symptoms of mild to moderate depression.
While the supplement is not FDA-approved for the treatment of depression, some research suggests that it may help reduce symptoms.9    Because St. John's wort affects serotonin levels in the brain, it can lead to a serious condition known as serotonin syndrome.
It can also interact with other medications, including antidepressants.
You should always talk to your doctor before trying any complementary treatment such as St. John's wort.
Does St. John's Wort Have Any Drug Interactions With Antidepressants?
Coping    While antidepressants are the most effective choice for people who have severe depression, lifestyle modifications may be a helpful choice for people who have more mild or moderate symptoms.
Get Regular Exercise    Regular physical activity has been shown to help prevent and treat depression.
Studies have even shown that exercise can be an effective first-line treatment in cases of mild to moderate depression.10    The good news is that you don't have to become a gym devotee to reap these depression-fighting rewards.
Moderate physical activity, such as walking for a total of three hours a week, can help.
Manage Stress Levels    Stress can contribute to and worsen symptoms of moderately severe depression, so finding ways to relax and manage your stress levels can be helpful.
One way to do this is to focus on relaxation techniques designed to improve your ability to tolerate and manage distressing emotions.
When faced with distress, people often rely on unhelpful coping mechanisms that can worsen symptoms of depression.
Some more helpful strategies include yoga, deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness.
Take Care of Yourself    Practicing good self-care can be helpful when coping with symptoms of depression.
It is important to remember, however, that depressive symptoms can often make taking care of yourself more difficult.
Feeling fatigued, unmotivated, disinterested, and distracted can interfere with normal daily tasks.
While it may require extra effort, doing some of the following can help you feel better:    Eat a healthy diet Seek out social support Engage in activities you enjoy    Try to avoid isolating yourself when you are feeling down.
Depression often causes people to withdraw from friends and loved ones, but reaching out to the people who care about you can actually help reduce feelings of depression.
If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

— Depression is a disorder that makes you sad, but it is different than normal sadness (figure 1).
Depression can make it hard for you to work, study, or do everyday tasks.How do I know if I am depressed?
— Depressed people feel down most of the time for at least 2 weeks.
They also have at least 1 of these 2 symptoms:●They no longer enjoy or care about doing the things they used to like to do.●They feel sad, down, hopeless, or cranky most of the day, almost every day.Depression can also make you:●Lose or gain weight●Sleep too much or too little●Feel tired or like you have no energy●Feel guilty or like you are worth nothing●Forget things or feel confused●Move and speak more slowly than usual●Act restless or have trouble staying still●Think about death or suicideIf you think you might be depressed, see your doctor or nurse.
Only someone trained in mental health can tell for sure if you are depressed.See someone right away if you want to hurt or kill yourself!
— If you ever feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, do one of these things:●Call your doctor or nurse and tell them it is urgent●Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)●Go to the emergency room at your local hospital●Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:•1-800-273-8255•www.suicidepreventionlifeline.orgWhat are the treatments for depression?
— People who have depression can get 1 or more of the following treatments:●Medicines that relieve depression●Counseling (with a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, or social worker)●A device that passes magnetic waves or electricity into the brainPeople with depression that is not too severe can get better by taking medicines or talking with a counselor.
People with severe depression usually need medicines to get better, and might also need to see a counselor.Another treatment involves placing a device against the scalp to pass magnetic waves into the brain.
This is called "transcranial magnetic stimulation" or "TMS."
Doctors might suggest TMS if medicines and counseling have not helped.
Some people whose depression is severe might need a treatment called "electroconvulsive therapy" or "ECT."
During ECT, doctors pass an electric current through a person's brain in a safe way.When will I feel better?
— Both treatment options take a little while to start working.●Many people who take medicines start to feel better within 2 weeks, but it might be 4 to 8 weeks before the medicine has its full effect.●Many people who see a counselor start to feel better within a few weeks, but it might take 8 to 10 weeks to get the greatest benefit.If the first treatment you try does not help you, tell your doctor or nurse, but do not give up.
Some people need to try different treatments or combinations of treatments before they find an approach that works.
Your doctor, nurse, or counselor can work with you to find the treatment that is right for you.
They can also help you figure out how to cope while you search for the right treatment or are waiting for your treatment to start working.How do I decide which treatment to have?
— You and your doctor or nurse will need to work together to choose a treatment for you.
Medicines might work a little faster than counseling.
But medicines can also cause side effects.
Plus, some people do not like the idea of taking medicine.On the other hand, seeing a counselor involves talking about your feelings with a stranger.
That is hard for some people.Is depression the same for teenagers?
— No.
The symptoms of depression are a little different for teenagers than they are for adults.
Some teenagers are moody or sad a lot of the time.
That makes it hard to tell when they are really depressed.
Teenagers who are depressed often seem cranky.
They get easily "annoyed" or "bothered."
They might even pick fights with people.
Also, when treating a teenager, doctors and nurses usually suggest trying counseling first, before trying medicine.
That's because there is a small chance that depression medicines can cause problems for some teenagers.
Even so, some depressed teenagers need medicine.
And most experts agree that depression medicine is safe and appropriate to use in teenagers who really need it.What if I take medicine for depression and I want to have a baby?
— Some depression medicines can cause problems for an unborn baby.
But having untreated depression during pregnancy can also cause problems.
If you want to get pregnant, tell your doctor but do not stop taking your medicines.
The two of you can plan the safest way for you to have your baby.It's also important to talk with your doctor if you want to breastfeed after your baby is born.
Breastfeeding has lots of benefits for both mother and baby.
Some depression medicines are safer than others to use while breastfeeding.
But having untreated depression after giving birth can also cause problems, so do not stop taking your medicines.
Your doctor can work with you to plan the safest way for you to feed your baby.More on this topic Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics) Patient education: Generalized anxiety disorder (The Basics) Patient education: Neuropathic pain (The Basics) Patient education: Seasonal affective disorder (The Basics) Patient education: When you have depression and another health problem (The Basics) Patient education: Serotonin syndrome (The Basics) Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Depression treatment options for children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Beyond the Basics) 	                                     Print                                                                OverviewDepression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest.

During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include:      Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness     Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters     Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports     Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much     Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort     Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain     Anxiety, agitation or restlessness     Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements     Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame     Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things     Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide     Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches  For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others.
Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.
Depression symptoms in children and teensCommon signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences.
In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight.
In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction.
Depression symptoms in older adultsDepression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly.
Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help.
Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as:      Memory difficulties or personality changes     Physical aches or pain     Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex — not caused by a medical condition or medication     Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things     Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men                                    When to see a doctorIf you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can.
If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.
When to get emergency helpIf you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.
Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts:      Call your doctor or mental health professional.
Call a suicide hotline number — in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).
Use that same number and press "1" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line.
Reach out to a close friend or loved one.
Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.
If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person.
Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.
Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.More InformationDepression (major depressive disorder) care at Mayo ClinicMale depression: Understanding the issuesNervous breakdown: What does it mean?Pain and depression: Is there a link?Show more related information                      Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic                                                      CausesIt's not known exactly what causes depression.
As with many mental disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, such as:      Biological differences.
People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains.
The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes.
Brain chemistry.
Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression.
Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment.
Hormones.
Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression.
Hormone changes can result with pregnancy and during the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum) and from thyroid problems, menopause or a number of other conditions.
Inherited traits.
Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have this condition.
Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression.

More women than men are diagnosed with depression, but this may be due in part because women are more likely to seek treatment.
Factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression include:      Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical or pessimistic     Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems     Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide     Being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or having variations in the development of genital organs that aren't clearly male or female (intersex) in an unsupportive situation     History of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder, eating disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder     Abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs     Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain or heart disease     Certain medications, such as some high blood pressure medications or sleeping pills (talk to your doctor before stopping any medication)                                    ComplicationsDepression is a serious disorder that can take a terrible toll on you and your family.
Depression often gets worse if it isn't treated, resulting in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your life.
Examples of complications associated with depression include:      Excess weight or obesity, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes     Pain or physical illness     Alcohol or drug misuse     Anxiety, panic disorder or social phobia     Family conflicts, relationship difficulties, and work or school problems     Social isolation     Suicidal feelings, suicide attempts or suicide     Self-mutilation, such as cutting     Premature death from medical conditions More InformationDepression (major depressive disorder) care at Mayo ClinicDepression and anxiety: Can I have both?
PreventionThere's no sure way to prevent depression.
However, these strategies may help.
Take steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and boost your self-esteem.
Reach out to family and friends, especially in times of crisis, to help you weather rough spells.
Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent depression from worsening.
Consider getting long-term maintenance treatment to help prevent a relapse of symptoms.

Many people think that depression just means a person is very sad.
However, depression can cause many symptoms in the body as well as mood problems.

According to the ICD-10, for a person to be diagnosed with depression, their symptoms have to last for at least two weeks.
The symptoms must happen every day, or almost every day.
These symptoms also have to cause problems in a person's life (like their work life, family life, social life, or other important parts of their life).
[1] Usually, for depression to be diagnosed, a person must have five or more of these symptoms:[1]  Depressed mood for most of the day (feelings of sadness, emptiness, and/or hopelessness) Teenagers may be irritable (they may get angry easily) instead of seeming depressed Feeling much less interested than usual in all, or almost all, activities; or not getting any pleasure from activities Significant weight loss (when not dieting) or weight gain (generally a change of 5% or more in body weight) Sleeping more than usual, or having trouble sleeping Moving around more than usual (psychomotor agitation) or moving more slowly than usual (psychomotor retardation) Feeling tired or not having energy, nearly every day Feeling worthless or guilty Not being able to think, concentrate, or make decisions normally Thinking a lot about death (not just being afraid to die) Most people who have not had depression do not completely understand its effects.
Instead, they see it as simply being sad.
Since it is not understood, many people criticize people with depression for not helping themselves.[source?]
Some people with depression die by suicide.
Depression is one of the mental illnesses that can cause a person to have suicidal thoughts.
Prevalence[change | change source] This section does not have any sources.
You can help Wikipedia by finding good sources, and adding them.
(September 2016)  It is impossible to get an exact number of how many people have depression.
There are many reasons for this.
For example:  People may not admit to having depression, because of the stigma about depression Some people may not be correctly diagnosed with depression Different doctors and mental health workers may diagnose depression differently The number of people diagnosed with depression is different in different cultures, and among men and women In different cultures[change | change source] Major depression is one of the most common mental illnesses in the United States.
[2] In 2014, 15.7 million adults in the United States had at least one episode of major depression.
This is about 6.7% of all adults in the United States.
[2] Around the world, depression causes more disability than any other mental health or behavioral illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[2] However, the prevalence of depression is different in different cultures and countries.
Prince (1968) found virtually no depression in most Asian and African countries.
However, psychologists such as Zhang and Kleinman have found disorders with similar symptoms, but different names.
For example, in the 1980s, Zhang found that in China, there was little mention of depression.
However, instead, a disorder called Neurasthenia was far more common.
When interviewing Neurasthenia patients, Zhang found that their symptoms matched the symptoms of depression by over 80%.
While the term "depression" was practically unheard of in China, Neurasthenia could well have been a similar disorder – or the same thing.
It is also important to take in different cultures ways of classifying depression.
For example, in China, many people believe doctors solve physical symptoms, not mental problems.
This may have made it more likely for "depression" to be diagnosed as a medical condition like "Neurasthenia."
In men and women[change | change source] Typically, in most Western cultures, women are diagnosed with depression twice as often as men.
However, men are often more likely than women to die by suicide.
[3]  In children[change | change source] Depression in children can be harder to see.
Children who are depressed may have a loss of appetite, meaning that they do not want to eat.
They may also be clearly having more trouble in everyday life than before.
For example, they may have sleep problems like nightmares; new problems with behaviour or grades at school; or be more irritable than usual.
[4]  Types of depression[change | change source] This section does not have any sources.
You can help Wikipedia by finding good sources, and adding them.
(September 2016)  Major depressive disorder is also referred to as major, biochemical, clinical, endogenous, or biological depression.
It may also be called unipolar affective disorder.
There are many subtypes of depression:  Melancholia, or melancholic depression, is very severe (bad).
It can cause many physical changes, like sleep and appetite changes.
It can also cause a person to change their behavior - for example, by not wanting to be around other people.
Psychotic depression is much like melancholia, but with hallucinations or delusions.
Atypical depression causes anxiety and panic attacks.
Chronic dysthymic disorder is a long-term, mild depression that lasts for at least two years.
It often begins in adolescence and lasts for many years.
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is when the depression seems to be related to the winter season.
It usually starts in the autumn and goes away in the spring every year.
It is common in Alaska, Canada, and Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland), but not in Iceland.
Causes of depression[change | change source] As of 2016, scientists believe there is no one cause of depression.
There is a lot of argument over whether depression is caused by biological, cognitive, or sociocultural factors:  Biological explanations of depression focus on changes in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters).
Cognitive explanations of depression focus on how the way we think (cognition) affects our mood.
These explanations say that if a person thinks negatively, this thinking can make them feel negatively about themselves and the world around them.
Sociocultural explanations of depression blame stressful things like divorce, losing a job, bullying, and poverty for causing depression.
The United States National Institutes of Health say that depression comes from the brain.
However, scientists are still trying to find out exactly why it happens.
[5]  Possible causes[change | change source] There are many theories about what causes depression.
These theories include:[source?]
Heredity (someone's genes): Depression often runs in families.
However, people can get depression even if they are not related to anyone else who has it.
Physiology: The amounts of some chemicals in the brain.
Serotonin is the main chemical in the brain that has to do with happiness.
Many antidepressant medications work by balancing the amount of serotonin in the brain.
Psychological factors: Low self-esteem and harmful thinking Early experiences: Events such as the death of a parent or guardian, abandonment or rejection, neglect, chronic illness, and severe physical, psychological, or sexual abuse.
Life experiences: Losing a job, homelessness, problems with money, death of a loved one, relationship problems, separation from a partner, being a victim of crime, or other life problems can cause depression.
Medical conditions: Some illnesses, such as hypothyroidism, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or head injuries, may contribute to depression.
Alcohol and other drugs: Alcohol can make people depressed.
If a person abuses alcohol, benzodiazepine-based tranquillizers, sleeping medications, or narcotics, it can affect how long their depression lasts and how bad it is.
Some medicines like birth control pills and steroids may also contribute to depression.
Pesticides: Several scientific studies [6][7][8][9][10][11] have found statistical links between depression and some pesticides.
Some depressed people also have other mental disorders, such as personality disorders and anxiety disorders.
Treatment[change | change source] Depression is usually treated with a combination of medication and other therapy.
Good exercise helps deal with depression, since exercise releases chemicals that put a person in a better mood.
[12] Having a supportive group of friends and doing outside activities can also help prevent or ease depression.
Medication[change | change source] There are many medications that can help with depression.
Many of these are called antidepressants.
Examples of medications used to treat depression include:[13]  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
These are now the most commonly used type of antidepressant medicine.
These drugs work by allowing the brain to have more serotonin.
They have fewer side effects than older antidepressants.
Examples include fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft).
Tricyclic antidepressants.
These are an older type of antidepressant.
They are not used often today because they have many bad side effects and do not work as well as SSRIs.
An example is nortriptyline (Allegron).
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
They may be used if other antidepressant medications do not work well.
This kind of medicine cannot be taken with many different foods and other medications.
Sometimes, antidepressant medicine works better when it is used together with another drug that is not an antidepressant.
These "augmentor" drugs include:[13]  Tranquillizers and sedatives.
These can help people sleep better and feel less anxious.
Antipsychotics.
These can help keep stop mood swings.
They can also make hallucinations better, or make them go away completely.
Lithium.
This is a mood stabilizer often used for bipolar disorder, but it can also help people with depression.
If people with depression do not take their medicine the right way, the depression can get worse.
A doctor must help when they want to change to another medication, or to take a different amount of a medication than before.
Psychotherapy[change | change source] Psychotherapy is often a helpful treatment for depression.
[14] In psychotherapy, a therapist helps a person to understand and solve problems which cause depression.
The therapist also helps the person learn skills for dealing with their depression.
[14] Psychotherapy can help a person make changes in the way they think, in order to help with life problems and understand what makes depression worse.
[14] The most effective psychotherapy for depression is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).[source?]
This teaches a person to think in a more rational, positive, realistic manner.
Surgeries and procedures[change | change source] Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), also called electroshock therapy or shock therapy, is used to treat a small percentage of severely depressed people.
ECT uses a small amount of electricity to cause an epileptic seizure while the patient is under anesthesia.
This may cause some memory loss (amnesia) or other side effects.
[15] In the past, doctors used different ways of treating depression.
These are rarely used any more.
They include:  Insulin shock treatment.
The doctor would lower a patient's blood sugar so much that the patient would have a seizure.
[16] Lobotomy.
This is a form of surgery.
The surgeon would use an ice pick or a surgical knife to cut nerves in the frontal lobe of the brain.
[17] Pet therapy[change | change source] Pet therapy and animal companionship can help people suffering from depression or anxiety.

If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy.The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life.There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page.
Psychological symptomsThe psychological symptoms of depression include:continuous low mood or sadnessfeeling hopeless and helplesshaving low self-esteemfeeling tearfulfeeling guilt-riddenfeeling irritable and intolerant of othershaving no motivation or interest in thingsfinding it difficult to make decisionsnot getting any enjoyment out of lifefeeling anxious or worriedhaving suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself                                                                                    Physical symptomsThe physical symptoms of depression include:moving or speaking more slowly than usualchanges in appetite or weight (usually decreased, but sometimes increased)constipationunexplained aches and painslack of energylow sex drive (loss of libido)changes to your menstrual cycledisturbed sleep – for example, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning                                                                                    Social symptomsThe social symptoms of depression include:avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activitiesneglecting your hobbies and interestshaving difficulties in your home, work or family life                                                                                    Severities of depressionDepression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong.
Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell.
It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong.Doctors describe depression by how serious it is:mild depression – has some impact on your daily lifemoderate depression – has a significant impact on your daily lifesevere depression – makes it almost impossible to get through daily life; a few people with severe depression may have psychotic symptoms                                                                                    Grief and depressionIt can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression.
They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them.Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness.People who are grieving find their feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but they're still able to enjoy things and look forward to the future.In contrast, people who are depressed constantly feel sad.
They find it difficult to enjoy anything or be positive about the future.Read more about coping with grief and bereavement                                                                                    Other types of depressionThere are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms.
These include:postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicinesbipolar disorder – also known as "manic depression", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to clinical depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sexseasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as "winter depression", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winterRead more about diagnosing depression                                                                                    When to seek helpSee a GP if you experience symptoms of depression for most of the day, every day, for more than 2 weeks.A low mood may improve after a short time.Read more about low mood and depression                                                                                               More in                        Clinical depression                                                                                                                             Overview - Clinical depression                                                                                                                   Symptoms - Clinical depression                                                                                                                     Causes - Clinical depression                                                                                                                                        Diagnosis - Clinical depression                                                                                                                                        Treatment - Clinical depression                                                                                                                                        Living with - Clinical depression                                                                                                                   Page last reviewed: 10 December 2019              Next review due: 10 December 2022       Depression        Share on Facebook       Share on Twitter       Share on Linkedin       Share on Pinterest 			Share via Email       Print this Page                     Mood Disorders                      What is depression?
Depression is a whole-body illness.
It involves the body, mood, and thoughts.
Depression affects the way you eat and sleep.
It also can affect the way you feel about yourself and things.
It is not the same as being unhappy or in a “blue” mood.
It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away.
When you have depression, you can’t “pull yourself together” and get better.
Treatment is often needed and many times crucial to recovery.
Depression has different forms, just like many other illnesses.
Three of the most common types of depressive disorders include:           Major depression.
This is a mixture of symptoms that affect your ability to work, sleep, eat, and enjoy life.
This can put you out of action for awhile.
These episodes of depression can happen once, twice, or several times in a lifetime.
Dysthymia.
This is a long-term, ongoing depressed mood and other symptoms that are not as severe or extensive as those in major depression.
These symptoms can still keep you from functioning at "full steam" or from feeling good.
Sometimes, people with dysthymia also experience major depressive episodes.
Bipolar disorder.
A chronic, recurring condition that includes cycles of extreme lows (or depression) and extreme highs (called hypomania or mania).
Depression and Sleep: Understanding the Connection                                              Depression and insomnia often go hand in hand.
Know the connection between the two, and learn how to recognize symptoms and get treatment for both.

There is no clear cause of depression.
Experts think it happens because of chemical imbalances in the brain.
Many factors can play a role in depression, including environmental, psychological, biological, and genetic factors.
Some types of depression seem to run in families.
However, no genes have yet been linked to depression.
Women have depression about twice as often as men.
Many hormonal factors may add to the increased rate of depression in women.
This includes menstrual cycle changes, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), pregnancy, miscarriage, postpartum period, perimenopause, and menopause.
Many women also deal with additional stresses such as responsibilities both at work and home, single parenthood, and caring for both children and aging parents.
Many women are especially at risk after giving birth to a baby.
Women experience hormonal and physical changes on top of the added responsibility of caring for a baby.
These can be factors that lead to postpartum depression in some women.
While the “baby blues" are common in new mothers (lasting a week or two), a full-blown depressive episode is not normal and treatment is needed.
What are the symptoms of depression?
The following are the most common symptoms of depression.
However, each person may experience symptoms differently.
Symptoms may include:           Lasting sad, anxious, or “empty” mood               Weight and/or appetite changes due to eating too much or eating too little               Changes in sleeping patterns, such as fitful sleep, inability to sleep, early morning awakening, or sleeping too much               Loss of interest and pleasure in activities formerly enjoyed, including sex               Increased restlessness and/or irritability               Decreased energy, fatigue, being "slowed down"               Feeling of worthless and/or helpless               Lasting feelings of hopelessness               Feelings of inappropriate guilt               Not being able to concentrate, think, and/or make decisions               Frequent thoughts of death or suicide, wishing to die, or attempting suicide (Note: People with this symptom should get treatment right away!)
Physical symptoms, such as headaches, digestive problems, and/or chronic pain that don’t get better with treatment       Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or even years.
Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people who suffer from depression.

Depression often happens along with other medical problems, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes.
It can also happen with other psychiatric disorders, such as substance abuse or anxiety disorders.
Getting an early diagnosis and treatment is crucial to recovery.
A diagnosis is made after a careful psychiatric exam and medical history done by a psychiatrist or other mental health professional.
How is depression treated?
Generally, based on the outcome of evaluations, treatment of depressive disorders may include one or a combination of the following:           Medication.
Many different drugs are available, but it often takes 4 to 6 weeks to feel the full effects of anti-depressants.
It’s important to keep taking the medicine, even if it doesn’t seem to be working at first.
It’s also important to talk to the doctor before stopping.
Some people have to switch medicines or add medicines to get results.
Psychotherapy.
This is most often cognitive-behavioral and/or interpersonal therapy.
It focuses on changing the distorted views you have of yourself and your environment.
It helps you work to improve your interpersonal relationship skills, and how to identify and manage stressors in your life.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
This treatment may be used in people with severe, life-threatening depression that has not responded to medicines.
An electrical current is passed through the brain, triggering a seizure.
For unknown reasons, the seizures help to restore the normal balance of chemicals in the brain and ease symptoms.
You can also do things to help yourself.
Depressive disorders can make you feel exhausted, worthless, helpless, and hopeless.
Such negative thoughts and feelings may make you feel like giving up.
It is important to realize that these negative views are part of the depression and typically do not accurately reflect the actual circumstances.
Negative thinking fades as treatment begins to take effect.
In the meantime, if you think you have depression, consider the following:           Get help.
If you think you may be depressed, see a health care provider as soon as possible.
Set realistic goals in light of the depression.
Take on only what you reasonably think you handle.
Break large tasks into small ones and set priorities.
Do what you can as you can.
Try to be with other people and confide in someone.
It is usually better than being alone and secretive.
Do things that make you feel better.
Going to a movie, gardening, or taking part in religious, social, or other activities may help.
Doing something nice for someone else can also help you feel better.
Get regular exercise.
Expect your mood to get better slowly, not right away.
Feeling better takes time.
Eat healthy, well-balanced meals.
Stay away from alcohol and drugs, which can make depression worse.
It is best to put off important decisions until the depression has lifted.
Before deciding to make a major life change — change jobs, get married, or divorced — discuss it with others who know you well.
They will have a more objective view of your situation.
Remember, people rarely “snap out of” a depression.
But with treatment they can feel a little better day-by-day.
Try to be patient and focus on the positives.
This may help replace the negative thinking that is part of the depression.
The negative thoughts will disappear as your depression responds to treatment.
Let your family and friends help you.

Depression may be diagnosed after a careful psychiatric exam.
A medical history will be done by a psychiatrist or other mental health professional.
Depression is most often treated with medication, psychotherapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy.
It can also be a combination of medication and therapy.
Next steps Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your health care provider:           Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.

Everyone goes through periods of feeling unhappy or listless, even children.
But if the feelings are very strong or persist for a long time, they might be caused by a medical problem.
Major depression, or simply “depression,” is a serious condition that can take over your child’s mood and thoughts.
The good news is that awareness and intervention from parents or other adults can help children with depression live normal and happy lives.
Childhood depression is a mental health disorder characterized by a sad mood that is both prolonged and severe.
Typically, children with depression are:      in a depressed or irritable mood for most of the day, nearly every day     show a noticeable decrease in interest or pleasure in nearly all activities     may have severe problems with eating, sleeping, energy, and concentration, feelings of worthlessness or extreme guilt, and even little desire to live  It’s important to understand that your child, or anyone with depression, cannot just "snap out of it."
Without treatment, symptoms can last for months or even years.
Depression in children has dramatically increased in recent years.
Between 7 and 14 percent of children will experience an episode of major depression before they turn 15.
Before puberty, boys and girls are equally at risk for depression.
By age 15, girls are twice as likely as boys to have experienced a major depressive episode.
Around 80 percent of people with major depression who seek treatment improve, usually within weeks.
What are the symptoms of depression?
While each child may experience symptoms differently, some of the most common include:      persistent feelings of sadness         feeling hopeless or helpless          having low self-esteem               feeling inadequate               excessive guilt               loss of interest in usual activities or activities once enjoyed               difficulty with relationships               sleeping too much or too little               changes in appetite or weight               decreased energy               difficulty concentrating               trouble making decisions               suicidal thoughts or attempts               frequent physical complaints such as headaches, stomach aches, or fatigue               running away or threats of running away from home               hypersensitivity to failure or rejection               irritability, hostility, aggression       What causes depression?
While the exact cause of depression and other mood disorders is not known, they've been linked to genetics and environmental factors.
The most common factors associated with depression include:      family history of depression     parents’ divorce     excessive stress     abuse or neglect     trauma (physical and/or emotional)     loss of a parent, caregiver, or other loved one     loss of a relationship, such as moving away or loss of boyfriend/girlfriend     failure to accomplish tasks such as learning to read, or keeping up with peers in other activities     chronic illnesses, such as diabetes     other psychiatric disorders     other developmental, learning, or conduct disorders  There are biological, psychological, and social factors that can contribute to depression separately or in combination.
Depression is thought to be caused by a difference in the structure and function of your child’s brain that controls the intensity of sad or irritable moods.
There may be a genetic component.
If other members of your family have had depression, your child is more likely to develop it, too.
A stressful environment at home, school, or in the community can contribute to depression.
Children may experience depression if they feels unhappy with their environment and powerless to make any change to it.
Low thyroid levels may sometimes cause fatigue, and other symptoms that may mimic symptoms of depression.
Your child’s doctor can discuss this with you in more detail.
What’s the difference between depression and grief?
Grief is a normal and natural response to loss.
While grief and depression share certain symptoms (e.g.
sadness, too much or too little sleep, changes in eating patterns), grief is not as constant.
In other words, a person who is grieving may feel very sad when thinking about or remembering the loss, but feel somewhat better around friends and family.
But someone with depression rarely finds relief from sadness.
What are the risks of depression?
If you think your child might be depressed, have an evaluation sooner rather than later.
If left untreated, depression could lead to:      failure in school     involvement in risky behaviors     difficulties with jobs and relationships in adulthood     attempted or successful suicide  How we care for children with depression The Boston Children’s Hospital Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences has long been at the forefront of providing expert, compassionate care to children and adolescents with mental health issues.
Our approach to mental health care is evidence-based — which means our treatments have been tested and proven effective through scientific studies, both here at our hospital and by other leading institutions worldwide.
Boston Children’s has a dedicated Psychopharmacology Clinic to help determine whether medication might be a helpful addition to the treatment plan.
For children's that need hospitalization, Boston Children's Inpatient Psychiatry Service provides family oriented psychiatric assessment and treatment with the goal of returning your child to a more comfortable environment for ongoing care.    What Is Moderate Depression?
While everyone feels down from time to time, depression is a serious mental health condition that can make it difficult to function normally.
But depression can vary in intensity.
How depression is experienced can vary from one person to the next, and the condition can also be classified as either mild, moderate, or severe.
One survey found that among U.S. adults with depression, approximately 20% had mild symptoms, 50% had moderate symptoms, and 30% had severe symptoms.1           Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States.
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 19.4 million (or 7.8%) of American adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2019.2   When a major depressive disorder is diagnosed, it is typically classified by the degree of severity (mild, moderate, or severe) as well as whether or not there are psychotic features or a seasonal pattern.
Moderately severe depression is marked by symptoms of depression that can affect a person’s ability to function normally.
It may differ from mild depression in terms of severity and frequency of symptoms that a person experiences.
Someone with moderate depression may experience symptoms that are more serious in terms of severity and duration than someone with mild depression.
They may also experience more symptoms than a person with mild depression does.
However, moderate depression is not listed as a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).
There is no official consensus on whether the number of symptoms is indicative of severity or whether the number of symptoms can be used to classify depression as mild, moderate, or severe.
Descriptions of depression severity are left to the discretion of the clinician, who may use depression rating scales to help determine the severity of the condition.
A Verywell Report: Americans Find Strength in Online Therapy            Symptoms    Moderately severe depression is marked by two main symptoms: persistent low mood and decreased interest in activities.
Some of the other symptoms of depression include:3          Avoiding social activities Changes in appetite Decreased productivity Despair and guilt Difficulty concentrating Difficulty sleeping Excessive worry Fatigue or lack of energy Feelings of hopelessness Irritability Lack of motivation Low self-esteem          Women are almost twice as likely to experience depression as men.
While moderate depression may be less severe, it does cause impairments in work, school, home, or social difficulties.4    Research also suggests that moderately severe depression increases certain health risks.
One study found that people who were moderately depressed had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those who were severely depressed.5    How Many People Are Actually Affected by Depression Every Year?
Diagnosis    In order to diagnose your condition, your doctor may perform a physical exam, ask questions about your medical history, and conduct lab tests to help rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be causing or contributing to your symptoms.
Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, is one condition that can lead to symptoms of depression, for example.
Your doctor will also ask questions about the symptoms that you have been experiencing including the type of symptoms you have, how long you have had them, and the degree to which they impact your life in different areas.
In some cases, your doctor may have you fill out a questionnaire to help screen you for depression.
The diagnosis of depression depends on the clinical judgment of a doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist.
Doctors and mental health professionals use the DSM-5 to help guide these diagnostic decisions.
The DSM-5 is published by the American Psychiatric Association and outlines diagnostic criteria for mental health conditions, including depression.
In order to be diagnosed with clinical depression, a person must exhibit at least five of the nine symptoms listed in the DSM-5 during a two-week period.
These symptoms of depression are:    Feeling depressed or irritable most of the day, every dayLosing interest or pleasure in activities most of the daySleep difficulties, including sleeping too much or too littleChanges in motor activityLow energy or fatigueChanges in weightFeelings of worthlessnessDifficulty concentratingSuicidal thoughts or behaviors     Moderately severe depression is generally marked by low mood and irritability most days as well as a loss of interest or enjoyment in activities that were previously pleasurable.
Such symptoms may vary in intensity and duration in someone with moderate depression.
They may experience some of these symptoms some weeks, but not others.
Where people with mild depression may be able to carry out their normal daily activities without much impairment, the symptoms of moderate depression are serious enough to create problems with work and home life.
People with moderately severe depression may struggle to complete daily tasks or feel fatigued and unmotivated.
At work, they may struggle to concentrate on projects.
Symptoms can also lead to problems in social relationships as well.
Get Advice From The Verywell Mind Podcast  Hosted by Editor-in-Chief and therapist Amy Morin, LCSW, this episode of The Verywell Mind Podcast shares how to find the courage to face depression, featuring Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez.
Follow Now: Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / RSS     Differential Diagnosis    Your doctor will also want to rule out other mental health conditions that can cause symptoms of depression.
Such conditions include:    Persistent depressive disorders (dysthymia): This type of depression is less severe than major depression but tends to be longer-lasting.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): This condition involves symptoms of depression that are experienced the week before and during a menstrual cycle.
Bipolar disorders: Bipolar I and II are marked by mood swings that include periods of depression.
Distinguishing Between Moderate and Severe Depression    While there is no clear consensus on how to rate the severity of depression, one study found that DSM-5 diagnostic criteria could be used to infer the severity of the condition.6      Depressed mood along with the presence of somatic symptoms was an indicator of moderate depression.
People with moderate depression are more likely to experience primary symptoms of low mood, sleep difficulties, weight or appetite changes, and increased/slowed psychomotor activity.
Anhedonia (the loss of interest or pleasure) along with non-somatic symptoms was an indicator of severe depression.
Along with losing interest in things that used to be pleasurable, people with severe depression are more likely to experience symptoms such as feelings of worthlessness and thoughts of death.
Causes    Depression is very common.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is the leading cause of ill health and disability globally.7    There is no single thing that causes depression.
In reality, there are a number of factors that are thought to contribute to the onset of depression.
Sex is one factor that can play a role since women experience depression at about twice the rate of men.
Other things that can contribute to depression include:    GeneticsHaving parents or other family members with depressionHaving another mental health conditionPovertyChronic health conditionsCertain medications    How Cognitive Distortions Fuel Depression      Treatments    Moderately severe depression may be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.
Psychotherapy    Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of therapy that is often used to treat depression.
CBT focuses on identifying negative thoughts that contribute to symptoms of depression.
Once these thought patterns have been identified, people then work to replace those thoughts with more positive and realistic ways of thinking.
CBT tends to be a shorter-term approach to therapy, so it may involve somewhere between 10 and 20 sessions.
During this time, you will also be expected to do homework outside of your therapy sessions.
This might involve practicing skills that you have learned during therapy as well as keeping a record of your symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors.
Examples of types of thinking that can contribute to symptoms of moderate depression include:    Overgeneralization, which involves applying one experience to all future experiences.
Automatic negative thoughts, which are types of thoughts that are self-defeating and irrational.
All-or-nothing thinking, which involves thinking of things in absolute terms.
This type of thinking causes people to see themselves in terms of extremes, either as successes or failures with no room for anything in between.
Ignoring or discounting positive experiences, which involves only focusing on the negative things that happen while not paying attention to the good things.
Magnifying problems, which can involve blowing up even small problems into much more serious issues than they really are.
Taking things personally, which can lead to feelings of blame, regret, or resentment.
Through journaling, you can begin to become more aware of these thought patterns and practice new ways of thinking about your experiences and problems.
It can also help you replace negative self-talk with more positive self-talk.
Other types of therapy that can be used to treat moderately severe depression include:    Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): This approach is a form of CBT that focuses on helping people with depression learn to tolerate distress, regulate their emotions, and improve their relationships with others.
Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This approach focuses on understanding how relationships with others can impact depression.
People then work to improve these social relationships and resolve existing conflicts.Psychodynamic therapy: This form of talk therapy, sometimes known as psychoanalytic therapy, focuses on helping people identify unconscious and unresolved conflicts that lead to troubling feelings.
Online therapy may also be a good option for some people with moderately severe depression.
One study found that guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) was effective for reducing symptoms of mild to moderate depression.8   How to Choose the Best Type of Therapy to Treat Your Depression     Medications    There are a number of different types of antidepressants that can be used to treat moderately severe depression.
The most commonly prescribed are known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
These include medications like Zoloft (sertraline), Prozac (fluoxetine), and Paxil (paroxetine).
While SSRIs are usually the preferred choice because they tend to have fewer side effects, other medications are sometimes prescribed.
Other types of antidepressants include serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), atypical antidepressants, and tricyclic antidepressants.
All antidepressants carry a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black box warning that their use may cause worsening symptoms and increased suicidal ideation in children, teens, and young adults under the age of 25.
Complementary and Alternative Treatments    There are some alternative remedies that may be helpful for some people who have mild to moderate depression.
St. John's wort, for example, is one herbal supplement that is sometimes used to help alleviate symptoms of mild to moderate depression.
While the supplement is not FDA-approved for the treatment of depression, some research suggests that it may help reduce symptoms.9    Because St. John's wort affects serotonin levels in the brain, it can lead to a serious condition known as serotonin syndrome.
It can also interact with other medications, including antidepressants.
You should always talk to your doctor before trying any complementary treatment such as St. John's wort.
Does St. John's Wort Have Any Drug Interactions With Antidepressants?
Coping    While antidepressants are the most effective choice for people who have severe depression, lifestyle modifications may be a helpful choice for people who have more mild or moderate symptoms.
Get Regular Exercise    Regular physical activity has been shown to help prevent and treat depression.
Studies have even shown that exercise can be an effective first-line treatment in cases of mild to moderate depression.10    The good news is that you don't have to become a gym devotee to reap these depression-fighting rewards.
Moderate physical activity, such as walking for a total of three hours a week, can help.
Manage Stress Levels    Stress can contribute to and worsen symptoms of moderately severe depression, so finding ways to relax and manage your stress levels can be helpful.
One way to do this is to focus on relaxation techniques designed to improve your ability to tolerate and manage distressing emotions.
When faced with distress, people often rely on unhelpful coping mechanisms that can worsen symptoms of depression.
Some more helpful strategies include yoga, deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness.
Take Care of Yourself    Practicing good self-care can be helpful when coping with symptoms of depression.
It is important to remember, however, that depressive symptoms can often make taking care of yourself more difficult.
Feeling fatigued, unmotivated, disinterested, and distracted can interfere with normal daily tasks.
While it may require extra effort, doing some of the following can help you feel better:    Eat a healthy diet Seek out social support Engage in activities you enjoy    Try to avoid isolating yourself when you are feeling down.
Depression often causes people to withdraw from friends and loved ones, but reaching out to the people who care about you can actually help reduce feelings of depression.
If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.

— Depression is a disorder that makes you sad, but it is different than normal sadness (figure 1).
Depression can make it hard for you to work, study, or do everyday tasks.How do I know if I am depressed?
— Depressed people feel down most of the time for at least 2 weeks.
They also have at least 1 of these 2 symptoms:●They no longer enjoy or care about doing the things they used to like to do.●They feel sad, down, hopeless, or cranky most of the day, almost every day.Depression can also make you:●Lose or gain weight●Sleep too much or too little●Feel tired or like you have no energy●Feel guilty or like you are worth nothing●Forget things or feel confused●Move and speak more slowly than usual●Act restless or have trouble staying still●Think about death or suicideIf you think you might be depressed, see your doctor or nurse.
Only someone trained in mental health can tell for sure if you are depressed.See someone right away if you want to hurt or kill yourself!
— If you ever feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, do one of these things:●Call your doctor or nurse and tell them it is urgent●Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)●Go to the emergency room at your local hospital●Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:•1-800-273-8255•www.suicidepreventionlifeline.orgWhat are the treatments for depression?
— People who have depression can get 1 or more of the following treatments:●Medicines that relieve depression●Counseling (with a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, or social worker)●A device that passes magnetic waves or electricity into the brainPeople with depression that is not too severe can get better by taking medicines or talking with a counselor.
People with severe depression usually need medicines to get better, and might also need to see a counselor.Another treatment involves placing a device against the scalp to pass magnetic waves into the brain.
This is called "transcranial magnetic stimulation" or "TMS."
Doctors might suggest TMS if medicines and counseling have not helped.
Some people whose depression is severe might need a treatment called "electroconvulsive therapy" or "ECT."
During ECT, doctors pass an electric current through a person's brain in a safe way.When will I feel better?
— Both treatment options take a little while to start working.●Many people who take medicines start to feel better within 2 weeks, but it might be 4 to 8 weeks before the medicine has its full effect.●Many people who see a counselor start to feel better within a few weeks, but it might take 8 to 10 weeks to get the greatest benefit.If the first treatment you try does not help you, tell your doctor or nurse, but do not give up.
Some people need to try different treatments or combinations of treatments before they find an approach that works.
Your doctor, nurse, or counselor can work with you to find the treatment that is right for you.
They can also help you figure out how to cope while you search for the right treatment or are waiting for your treatment to start working.How do I decide which treatment to have?
— You and your doctor or nurse will need to work together to choose a treatment for you.
Medicines might work a little faster than counseling.
But medicines can also cause side effects.
Plus, some people do not like the idea of taking medicine.On the other hand, seeing a counselor involves talking about your feelings with a stranger.
That is hard for some people.Is depression the same for teenagers?
— No.
The symptoms of depression are a little different for teenagers than they are for adults.
Some teenagers are moody or sad a lot of the time.
That makes it hard to tell when they are really depressed.
Teenagers who are depressed often seem cranky.
They get easily "annoyed" or "bothered."
They might even pick fights with people.
Also, when treating a teenager, doctors and nurses usually suggest trying counseling first, before trying medicine.
That's because there is a small chance that depression medicines can cause problems for some teenagers.
Even so, some depressed teenagers need medicine.
And most experts agree that depression medicine is safe and appropriate to use in teenagers who really need it.What if I take medicine for depression and I want to have a baby?
— Some depression medicines can cause problems for an unborn baby.
But having untreated depression during pregnancy can also cause problems.
If you want to get pregnant, tell your doctor but do not stop taking your medicines.
The two of you can plan the safest way for you to have your baby.It's also important to talk with your doctor if you want to breastfeed after your baby is born.
Breastfeeding has lots of benefits for both mother and baby.
Some depression medicines are safer than others to use while breastfeeding.
But having untreated depression after giving birth can also cause problems, so do not stop taking your medicines.
Your doctor can work with you to plan the safest way for you to feed your baby.More on this topic Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics) Patient education: Generalized anxiety disorder (The Basics) Patient education: Neuropathic pain (The Basics) Patient education: Seasonal affective disorder (The Basics) Patient education: When you have depression and another health problem (The Basics) Patient education: Serotonin syndrome (The Basics) Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Depression treatment options for children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics) Patient education: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Beyond the Basics) 	                                     Print                                                                OverviewDepression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest.

During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include:      Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness     Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters     Loss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports     Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much     Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort     Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain     Anxiety, agitation or restlessness     Slowed thinking, speaking or body movements     Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame     Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things     Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide     Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches  For many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others.
Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.
Depression symptoms in children and teensCommon signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences.
In younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight.
In teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction.
Depression symptoms in older adultsDepression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly.
Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help.
Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as:      Memory difficulties or personality changes     Physical aches or pain     Fatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex — not caused by a medical condition or medication     Often wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things     Suicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men                                    When to see a doctorIf you feel depressed, make an appointment to see your doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can.
If you're reluctant to seek treatment, talk to a friend or loved one, any health care professional, a faith leader, or someone else you trust.
When to get emergency helpIf you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.
Also consider these options if you're having suicidal thoughts:      Call your doctor or mental health professional.
Call a suicide hotline number — in the U.S., call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).
Use that same number and press "1" to reach the Veterans Crisis Line.
Reach out to a close friend or loved one.
Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone else in your faith community.
If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person.
Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.
Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room.More InformationDepression (major depressive disorder) care at Mayo ClinicMale depression: Understanding the issuesNervous breakdown: What does it mean?Pain and depression: Is there a link?Show more related information                      Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic                                                      CausesIt's not known exactly what causes depression.
As with many mental disorders, a variety of factors may be involved, such as:      Biological differences.
People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains.
The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes.
Brain chemistry.
Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression.
Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment.
Hormones.
Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression.
Hormone changes can result with pregnancy and during the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum) and from thyroid problems, menopause or a number of other conditions.
Inherited traits.
Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have this condition.
Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression.

More women than men are diagnosed with depression, but this may be due in part because women are more likely to seek treatment.
Factors that seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering depression include:      Certain personality traits, such as low self-esteem and being too dependent, self-critical or pessimistic     Traumatic or stressful events, such as physical or sexual abuse, the death or loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or financial problems     Blood relatives with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism or suicide     Being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, or having variations in the development of genital organs that aren't clearly male or female (intersex) in an unsupportive situation     History of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder, eating disorders or post-traumatic stress disorder     Abuse of alcohol or recreational drugs     Serious or chronic illness, including cancer, stroke, chronic pain or heart disease     Certain medications, such as some high blood pressure medications or sleeping pills (talk to your doctor before stopping any medication)                                    ComplicationsDepression is a serious disorder that can take a terrible toll on you and your family.
Depression often gets worse if it isn't treated, resulting in emotional, behavioral and health problems that affect every area of your life.
Examples of complications associated with depression include:      Excess weight or obesity, which can lead to heart disease and diabetes     Pain or physical illness     Alcohol or drug misuse     Anxiety, panic disorder or social phobia     Family conflicts, relationship difficulties, and work or school problems     Social isolation     Suicidal feelings, suicide attempts or suicide     Self-mutilation, such as cutting     Premature death from medical conditions More InformationDepression (major depressive disorder) care at Mayo ClinicDepression and anxiety: Can I have both?
PreventionThere's no sure way to prevent depression.
However, these strategies may help.
Take steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and boost your self-esteem.
Reach out to family and friends, especially in times of crisis, to help you weather rough spells.
Get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem to help prevent depression from worsening.
Consider getting long-term maintenance treatment to help prevent a relapse of symptoms.

Many people think that depression just means a person is very sad.
However, depression can cause many symptoms in the body as well as mood problems.

According to the ICD-10, for a person to be diagnosed with depression, their symptoms have to last for at least two weeks.
The symptoms must happen every day, or almost every day.
These symptoms also have to cause problems in a person's life (like their work life, family life, social life, or other important parts of their life).
[1] Usually, for depression to be diagnosed, a person must have five or more of these symptoms:[1]  Depressed mood for most of the day (feelings of sadness, emptiness, and/or hopelessness) Teenagers may be irritable (they may get angry easily) instead of seeming depressed Feeling much less interested than usual in all, or almost all, activities; or not getting any pleasure from activities Significant weight loss (when not dieting) or weight gain (generally a change of 5% or more in body weight) Sleeping more than usual, or having trouble sleeping Moving around more than usual (psychomotor agitation) or moving more slowly than usual (psychomotor retardation) Feeling tired or not having energy, nearly every day Feeling worthless or guilty Not being able to think, concentrate, or make decisions normally Thinking a lot about death (not just being afraid to die) Most people who have not had depression do not completely understand its effects.
Instead, they see it as simply being sad.
Since it is not understood, many people criticize people with depression for not helping themselves.[source?]
Some people with depression die by suicide.
Depression is one of the mental illnesses that can cause a person to have suicidal thoughts.
Prevalence[change | change source] This section does not have any sources.

(September 2016)  It is impossible to get an exact number of how many people have depression.
There are many reasons for this.
For example:  People may not admit to having depression, because of the stigma about depression Some people may not be correctly diagnosed with depression Different doctors and mental health workers may diagnose depression differently The number of people diagnosed with depression is different in different cultures, and among men and women In different cultures[change | change source] Major depression is one of the most common mental illnesses in the United States.
[2] In 2014, 15.7 million adults in the United States had at least one episode of major depression.
This is about 6.7% of all adults in the United States.
[2] Around the world, depression causes more disability than any other mental health or behavioral illness, according to the World Health Organization.
[2] However, the prevalence of depression is different in different cultures and countries.
Prince (1968) found virtually no depression in most Asian and African countries.
However, psychologists such as Zhang and Kleinman have found disorders with similar symptoms, but different names.
For example, in the 1980s, Zhang found that in China, there was little mention of depression.
However, instead, a disorder called Neurasthenia was far more common.
When interviewing Neurasthenia patients, Zhang found that their symptoms matched the symptoms of depression by over 80%.
While the term "depression" was practically unheard of in China, Neurasthenia could well have been a similar disorder – or the same thing.
It is also important to take in different cultures ways of classifying depression.
For example, in China, many people believe doctors solve physical symptoms, not mental problems.
This may have made it more likely for "depression" to be diagnosed as a medical condition like "Neurasthenia."
In men and women[change | change source] Typically, in most Western cultures, women are diagnosed with depression twice as often as men.
However, men are often more likely than women to die by suicide.
[3]  In children[change | change source] Depression in children can be harder to see.
Children who are depressed may have a loss of appetite, meaning that they do not want to eat.
They may also be clearly having more trouble in everyday life than before.
For example, they may have sleep problems like nightmares; new problems with behaviour or grades at school; or be more irritable than usual.

(September 2016)  Major depressive disorder is also referred to as major, biochemical, clinical, endogenous, or biological depression.
It may also be called unipolar affective disorder.
There are many subtypes of depression:  Melancholia, or melancholic depression, is very severe (bad).
It can cause many physical changes, like sleep and appetite changes.
It can also cause a person to change their behavior - for example, by not wanting to be around other people.
Psychotic depression is much like melancholia, but with hallucinations or delusions.
Atypical depression causes anxiety and panic attacks.
Chronic dysthymic disorder is a long-term, mild depression that lasts for at least two years.
It often begins in adolescence and lasts for many years.
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is when the depression seems to be related to the winter season.
It usually starts in the autumn and goes away in the spring every year.
It is common in Alaska, Canada, and Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland), but not in Iceland.
Causes of depression[change | change source] As of 2016, scientists believe there is no one cause of depression.
There is a lot of argument over whether depression is caused by biological, cognitive, or sociocultural factors:  Biological explanations of depression focus on changes in brain chemicals (neurotransmitters).
Cognitive explanations of depression focus on how the way we think (cognition) affects our mood.
These explanations say that if a person thinks negatively, this thinking can make them feel negatively about themselves and the world around them.
Sociocultural explanations of depression blame stressful things like divorce, losing a job, bullying, and poverty for causing depression.
The United States National Institutes of Health say that depression comes from the brain.
However, scientists are still trying to find out exactly why it happens.
[5]  Possible causes[change | change source] There are many theories about what causes depression.
These theories include:[source?]
Heredity (someone's genes): Depression often runs in families.
However, people can get depression even if they are not related to anyone else who has it.
Physiology: The amounts of some chemicals in the brain.
Serotonin is the main chemical in the brain that has to do with happiness.
Many antidepressant medications work by balancing the amount of serotonin in the brain.
Psychological factors: Low self-esteem and harmful thinking Early experiences: Events such as the death of a parent or guardian, abandonment or rejection, neglect, chronic illness, and severe physical, psychological, or sexual abuse.
Life experiences: Losing a job, homelessness, problems with money, death of a loved one, relationship problems, separation from a partner, being a victim of crime, or other life problems can cause depression.
Medical conditions: Some illnesses, such as hypothyroidism, hepatitis, mononucleosis, or head injuries, may contribute to depression.
Alcohol and other drugs: Alcohol can make people depressed.
If a person abuses alcohol, benzodiazepine-based tranquillizers, sleeping medications, or narcotics, it can affect how long their depression lasts and how bad it is.
Some medicines like birth control pills and steroids may also contribute to depression.
Pesticides: Several scientific studies [6][7][8][9][10][11] have found statistical links between depression and some pesticides.
Some depressed people also have other mental disorders, such as personality disorders and anxiety disorders.
Treatment[change | change source] Depression is usually treated with a combination of medication and other therapy.
Good exercise helps deal with depression, since exercise releases chemicals that put a person in a better mood.
[12] Having a supportive group of friends and doing outside activities can also help prevent or ease depression.
Medication[change | change source] There are many medications that can help with depression.
Many of these are called antidepressants.
Examples of medications used to treat depression include:[13]  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
These are now the most commonly used type of antidepressant medicine.
These drugs work by allowing the brain to have more serotonin.
They have fewer side effects than older antidepressants.
Examples include fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft).
Tricyclic antidepressants.
These are an older type of antidepressant.
They are not used often today because they have many bad side effects and do not work as well as SSRIs.
An example is nortriptyline (Allegron).
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
They may be used if other antidepressant medications do not work well.
This kind of medicine cannot be taken with many different foods and other medications.
Sometimes, antidepressant medicine works better when it is used together with another drug that is not an antidepressant.
These "augmentor" drugs include:[13]  Tranquillizers and sedatives.
These can help people sleep better and feel less anxious.
Antipsychotics.
These can help keep stop mood swings.
They can also make hallucinations better, or make them go away completely.
Lithium.
This is a mood stabilizer often used for bipolar disorder, but it can also help people with depression.
If people with depression do not take their medicine the right way, the depression can get worse.
A doctor must help when they want to change to another medication, or to take a different amount of a medication than before.
Psychotherapy[change | change source] Psychotherapy is often a helpful treatment for depression.
[14] In psychotherapy, a therapist helps a person to understand and solve problems which cause depression.
The therapist also helps the person learn skills for dealing with their depression.
[14] Psychotherapy can help a person make changes in the way they think, in order to help with life problems and understand what makes depression worse.
[14] The most effective psychotherapy for depression is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).[source?]
This teaches a person to think in a more rational, positive, realistic manner.
Surgeries and procedures[change | change source] Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), also called electroshock therapy or shock therapy, is used to treat a small percentage of severely depressed people.
ECT uses a small amount of electricity to cause an epileptic seizure while the patient is under anesthesia.
This may cause some memory loss (amnesia) or other side effects.
[15] In the past, doctors used different ways of treating depression.
These are rarely used any more.
They include:  Insulin shock treatment.
The doctor would lower a patient's blood sugar so much that the patient would have a seizure.
[16] Lobotomy.
This is a form of surgery.
The surgeon would use an ice pick or a surgical knife to cut nerves in the frontal lobe of the brain.
[17] Pet therapy[change | change source] Pet therapy and animal companionship can help people suffering from depression or anxiety.

If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy.The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life.There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page.
Psychological symptomsThe psychological symptoms of depression include:continuous low mood or sadnessfeeling hopeless and helplesshaving low self-esteemfeeling tearfulfeeling guilt-riddenfeeling irritable and intolerant of othershaving no motivation or interest in thingsfinding it difficult to make decisionsnot getting any enjoyment out of lifefeeling anxious or worriedhaving suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself                                                                                    Physical symptomsThe physical symptoms of depression include:moving or speaking more slowly than usualchanges in appetite or weight (usually decreased, but sometimes increased)constipationunexplained aches and painslack of energylow sex drive (loss of libido)changes to your menstrual cycledisturbed sleep – for example, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning                                                                                    Social symptomsThe social symptoms of depression include:avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activitiesneglecting your hobbies and interestshaving difficulties in your home, work or family life                                                                                    Severities of depressionDepression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong.
Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell.
It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong.Doctors describe depression by how serious it is:mild depression – has some impact on your daily lifemoderate depression – has a significant impact on your daily lifesevere depression – makes it almost impossible to get through daily life; a few people with severe depression may have psychotic symptoms                                                                                    Grief and depressionIt can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression.
They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them.Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness.People who are grieving find their feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but they're still able to enjoy things and look forward to the future.In contrast, people who are depressed constantly feel sad.
They find it difficult to enjoy anything or be positive about the future.Read more about coping with grief and bereavement                                                                                    Other types of depressionThere are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms.
These include:postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicinesbipolar disorder – also known as "manic depression", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to clinical depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sexseasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as "winter depression", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winterRead more about diagnosing depression                                                                                    When to seek helpSee a GP if you experience symptoms of depression for most of the day, every day, for more than 2 weeks.A low mood may improve after a short time.Read more about low mood and depression                                                                                               More in                        Clinical depression                                                                                                                             Overview - Clinical depression                                                                                                                   Symptoms - Clinical depression                                                                                                                     Causes - Clinical depression                                                                                                                                        Diagnosis - Clinical depression                                                                                                                                        Treatment - Clinical depression                                                                                                                                        Living with - Clinical depression                                                                                                                   Page last reviewed: 10 December 2019              Next review due: 10 December 2022       Depression        Share on Facebook       Share on Twitter       Share on Linkedin       Share on Pinterest 			Share via Email       Print this Page                     Mood Disorders                      What is depression?
Depression is a whole-body illness.
It involves the body, mood, and thoughts.
Depression affects the way you eat and sleep.
It also can affect the way you feel about yourself and things.
It is not the same as being unhappy or in a “blue” mood.
It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away.
When you have depression, you can’t “pull yourself together” and get better.
Treatment is often needed and many times crucial to recovery.
Depression has different forms, just like many other illnesses.
Three of the most common types of depressive disorders include:           Major depression.
This is a mixture of symptoms that affect your ability to work, sleep, eat, and enjoy life.
This can put you out of action for awhile.
These episodes of depression can happen once, twice, or several times in a lifetime.
Dysthymia.
This is a long-term, ongoing depressed mood and other symptoms that are not as severe or extensive as those in major depression.
These symptoms can still keep you from functioning at "full steam" or from feeling good.
Sometimes, people with dysthymia also experience major depressive episodes.
Bipolar disorder.
A chronic, recurring condition that includes cycles of extreme lows (or depression) and extreme highs (called hypomania or mania).
Depression and Sleep: Understanding the Connection                                              Depression and insomnia often go hand in hand.
Know the connection between the two, and learn how to recognize symptoms and get treatment for both.

There is no clear cause of depression.
Experts think it happens because of chemical imbalances in the brain.
Many factors can play a role in depression, including environmental, psychological, biological, and genetic factors.
Some types of depression seem to run in families.
However, no genes have yet been linked to depression.
Women have depression about twice as often as men.
Many hormonal factors may add to the increased rate of depression in women.
This includes menstrual cycle changes, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), pregnancy, miscarriage, postpartum period, perimenopause, and menopause.
Many women also deal with additional stresses such as responsibilities both at work and home, single parenthood, and caring for both children and aging parents.
Many women are especially at risk after giving birth to a baby.
Women experience hormonal and physical changes on top of the added responsibility of caring for a baby.
These can be factors that lead to postpartum depression in some women.
While the “baby blues" are common in new mothers (lasting a week or two), a full-blown depressive episode is not normal and treatment is needed.
What are the symptoms of depression?
The following are the most common symptoms of depression.
However, each person may experience symptoms differently.
Symptoms may include:           Lasting sad, anxious, or “empty” mood               Weight and/or appetite changes due to eating too much or eating too little               Changes in sleeping patterns, such as fitful sleep, inability to sleep, early morning awakening, or sleeping too much               Loss of interest and pleasure in activities formerly enjoyed, including sex               Increased restlessness and/or irritability               Decreased energy, fatigue, being "slowed down"               Feeling of worthless and/or helpless               Lasting feelings of hopelessness               Feelings of inappropriate guilt               Not being able to concentrate, think, and/or make decisions               Frequent thoughts of death or suicide, wishing to die, or attempting suicide (Note: People with this symptom should get treatment right away!)
Physical symptoms, such as headaches, digestive problems, and/or chronic pain that don’t get better with treatment       Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or even years.
Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people who suffer from depression.

Depression often happens along with other medical problems, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes.
It can also happen with other psychiatric disorders, such as substance abuse or anxiety disorders.
Getting an early diagnosis and treatment is crucial to recovery.
A diagnosis is made after a careful psychiatric exam and medical history done by a psychiatrist or other mental health professional.
How is depression treated?
Generally, based on the outcome of evaluations, treatment of depressive disorders may include one or a combination of the following:           Medication.
Many different drugs are available, but it often takes 4 to 6 weeks to feel the full effects of anti-depressants.
It’s important to keep taking the medicine, even if it doesn’t seem to be working at first.
It’s also important to talk to the doctor before stopping.
Some people have to switch medicines or add medicines to get results.
Psychotherapy.
This is most often cognitive-behavioral and/or interpersonal therapy.
It focuses on changing the distorted views you have of yourself and your environment.
It helps you work to improve your interpersonal relationship skills, and how to identify and manage stressors in your life.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
This treatment may be used in people with severe, life-threatening depression that has not responded to medicines.
An electrical current is passed through the brain, triggering a seizure.
For unknown reasons, the seizures help to restore the normal balance of chemicals in the brain and ease symptoms.
You can also do things to help yourself.
Depressive disorders can make you feel exhausted, worthless, helpless, and hopeless.
Such negative thoughts and feelings may make you feel like giving up.
It is important to realize that these negative views are part of the depression and typically do not accurately reflect the actual circumstances.
Negative thinking fades as treatment begins to take effect.
In the meantime, if you think you have depression, consider the following:           Get help.
If you think you may be depressed, see a health care provider as soon as possible.
Set realistic goals in light of the depression.
Take on only what you reasonably think you handle.
Break large tasks into small ones and set priorities.
Do what you can as you can.
Try to be with other people and confide in someone.
It is usually better than being alone and secretive.
Do things that make you feel better.
Going to a movie, gardening, or taking part in religious, social, or other activities may help.
Doing something nice for someone else can also help you feel better.
Get regular exercise.
Expect your mood to get better slowly, not right away.
Feeling better takes time.
Eat healthy, well-balanced meals.
Stay away from alcohol and drugs, which can make depression worse.
It is best to put off important decisions until the depression has lifted.
Before deciding to make a major life change — change jobs, get married, or divorced — discuss it with others who know you well.
They will have a more objective view of your situation.
Remember, people rarely “snap out of” a depression.
But with treatment they can feel a little better day-by-day.
Try to be patient and focus on the positives.
This may help replace the negative thinking that is part of the depression.
The negative thoughts will disappear as your depression responds to treatment.
Let your family and friends help you.
Key points           Depression is a whole-body illness.
This means that it involves the body, mood, and thoughts.
It is not the same as being unhappy or in a “blue” mood.
Treatment is often needed and many times crucial to recovery.
There is no clear cause of depression, but doctors think it’s a result of chemical imbalances in the brain.
Some types of depression seem to run in families, but no genes have yet been linked to depression.
Women experience depression about twice as often as men.
Many hormonal factors may play a role in the increased rate of depression in women.
These factors may include menstrual cycle changes, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), pregnancy, miscarriage, postpartum period, perimenopause, and menopause.
In general, nearly everyone suffering from depression has ongoing feelings of sadness.
They may feel helpless, hopeless, and irritable.
Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years.
Depression may be diagnosed after a careful psychiatric exam.
A medical history will be done by a psychiatrist or other mental health professional.
Depression is most often treated with medication, psychotherapy, or cognitive behavioral therapy.
It can also be a combination of medication and therapy.
Next steps Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your health care provider:           Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.
At the visit, write down the names of new medicines, treatments, or tests, and any new instructions your provider gives you.
If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.                             What is depression?
Everyone goes through periods of feeling unhappy or listless, even children.
But if the feelings are very strong or persist for a long time, they might be caused by a medical problem.
Major depression, or simply “depression,” is a serious condition that can take over your child’s mood and thoughts.
The good news is that awareness and intervention from parents or other adults can help children with depression live normal and happy lives.
Childhood depression is a mental health disorder characterized by a sad mood that is both prolonged and severe.
Typically, children with depression are:      in a depressed or irritable mood for most of the day, nearly every day     show a noticeable decrease in interest or pleasure in nearly all activities     may have severe problems with eating, sleeping, energy, and concentration, feelings of worthlessness or extreme guilt, and even little desire to live  It’s important to understand that your child, or anyone with depression, cannot just "snap out of it."
Without treatment, symptoms can last for months or even years.
Depression in children has dramatically increased in recent years.
Between 7 and 14 percent of children will experience an episode of major depression before they turn 15.
Before puberty, boys and girls are equally at risk for depression.
By age 15, girls are twice as likely as boys to have experienced a major depressive episode.
Around 80 percent of people with major depression who seek treatment improve, usually within weeks.
What are the symptoms of depression?
While each child may experience symptoms differently, some of the most common include:      persistent feelings of sadness         feeling hopeless or helpless          having low self-esteem               feeling inadequate               excessive guilt               loss of interest in usual activities or activities once enjoyed               difficulty with relationships               sleeping too much or too little               changes in appetite or weight               decreased energy               difficulty concentrating               trouble making decisions               suicidal thoughts or attempts               frequent physical complaints such as headaches, stomach aches, or fatigue               running away or threats of running away from home               hypersensitivity to failure or rejection               irritability, hostility, aggression       What causes depression?
While the exact cause of depression and other mood disorders is not known, they've been linked to genetics and environmental factors.
The most common factors associated with depression include:      family history of depression     parents’ divorce     excessive stress     abuse or neglect     trauma (physical and/or emotional)     loss of a parent, caregiver, or other loved one     loss of a relationship, such as moving away or loss of boyfriend/girlfriend     failure to accomplish tasks such as learning to read, or keeping up with peers in other activities     chronic illnesses, such as diabetes     other psychiatric disorders     other developmental, learning, or conduct disorders  There are biological, psychological, and social factors that can contribute to depression separately or in combination.
Depression is thought to be caused by a difference in the structure and function of your child’s brain that controls the intensity of sad or irritable moods.
There may be a genetic component.
If other members of your family have had depression, your child is more likely to develop it, too.
A stressful environment at home, school, or in the community can contribute to depression.
Children may experience depression if they feels unhappy with their environment and powerless to make any change to it.
Low thyroid levels may sometimes cause fatigue, and other symptoms that may mimic symptoms of depression.
Your child’s doctor can discuss this with you in more detail.
What’s the difference between depression and grief?
Grief is a normal and natural response to loss.
While grief and depression share certain symptoms (e.g.
sadness, too much or too little sleep, changes in eating patterns), grief is not as constant.
In other words, a person who is grieving may feel very sad when thinking about or remembering the loss, but feel somewhat better around friends and family.
But someone with depression rarely finds relief from sadness.
What are the risks of depression?
If you think your child might be depressed, have an evaluation sooner rather than later.
If left untreated, depression could lead to:      failure in school     involvement in risky behaviors     difficulties with jobs and relationships in adulthood     attempted or successful suicide  How we care for children with depression The Boston Children’s Hospital Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences has long been at the forefront of providing expert, compassionate care to children and adolescents with mental health issues.
Our approach to mental health care is evidence-based — which means our treatments have been tested and proven effective through scientific studies, both here at our hospital and by other leading institutions worldwide.
Boston Children’s has a dedicated Psychopharmacology Clinic to help determine whether medication might be a helpful addition to the treatment plan.
For children's that need hospitalization, Boston Children's Inpatient Psychiatry Service provides family oriented psychiatric assessment and treatment with the goal of returning your child to a more comfortable environment for ongoing care.    What Is Moderate Depression?
While everyone feels down from time to time, depression is a serious mental health condition that can make it difficult to function normally.
But depression can vary in intensity.
How depression is experienced can vary from one person to the next, and the condition can also be classified as either mild, moderate, or severe.
One survey found that among U.S. adults with depression, approximately 20% had mild symptoms, 50% had moderate symptoms, and 30% had severe symptoms.1           Depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States.
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, an estimated 19.4 million (or 7.8%) of American adults in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2019.2   When a major depressive disorder is diagnosed, it is typically classified by the degree of severity (mild, moderate, or severe) as well as whether or not there are psychotic features or a seasonal pattern.
Moderately severe depression is marked by symptoms of depression that can affect a person’s ability to function normally.
It may differ from mild depression in terms of severity and frequency of symptoms that a person experiences.
Someone with moderate depression may experience symptoms that are more serious in terms of severity and duration than someone with mild depression.
They may also experience more symptoms than a person with mild depression does.
However, moderate depression is not listed as a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).
There is no official consensus on whether the number of symptoms is indicative of severity or whether the number of symptoms can be used to classify depression as mild, moderate, or severe.
Descriptions of depression severity are left to the discretion of the clinician, who may use depression rating scales to help determine the severity of the condition.
A Verywell Report: Americans Find Strength in Online Therapy              1:39    Click Play to Learn More About Living With Depression              This video has been medically reviewed by Daniel B.
Block, MD.
Symptoms    Moderately severe depression is marked by two main symptoms: persistent low mood and decreased interest in activities.
Some of the other symptoms of depression include:3          Avoiding social activities Changes in appetite Decreased productivity Despair and guilt Difficulty concentrating Difficulty sleeping Excessive worry Fatigue or lack of energy Feelings of hopelessness Irritability Lack of motivation Low self-esteem    Women are almost twice as likely to experience depression as men.
While moderate depression may be less severe, it does cause impairments in work, school, home, or social difficulties.4    Research also suggests that moderately severe depression increases certain health risks.
One study found that people who were moderately depressed had a higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared to those who were severely depressed.5    How Many People Are Actually Affected by Depression Every Year?
Diagnosis    In order to diagnose your condition, your doctor may perform a physical exam, ask questions about your medical history, and conduct lab tests to help rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be causing or contributing to your symptoms.
Hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, is one condition that can lead to symptoms of depression, for example.
Your doctor will also ask questions about the symptoms that you have been experiencing including the type of symptoms you have, how long you have had them, and the degree to which they impact your life in different areas.
In some cases, your doctor may have you fill out a questionnaire to help screen you for depression.
The diagnosis of depression depends on the clinical judgment of a doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist.
Doctors and mental health professionals use the DSM-5 to help guide these diagnostic decisions.
The DSM-5 is published by the American Psychiatric Association and outlines diagnostic criteria for mental health conditions, including depression.
In order to be diagnosed with clinical depression, a person must exhibit at least five of the nine symptoms listed in the DSM-5 during a two-week period.
These symptoms of depression are:    Feeling depressed or irritable most of the day, every dayLosing interest or pleasure in activities most of the daySleep difficulties, including sleeping too much or too littleChanges in motor activityLow energy or fatigueChanges in weightFeelings of worthlessnessDifficulty concentratingSuicidal thoughts or behaviors     Moderately severe depression is generally marked by low mood and irritability most days as well as a loss of interest or enjoyment in activities that were previously pleasurable.
Such symptoms may vary in intensity and duration in someone with moderate depression.
They may experience some of these symptoms some weeks, but not others.
Where people with mild depression may be able to carry out their normal daily activities without much impairment, the symptoms of moderate depression are serious enough to create problems with work and home life.
People with moderately severe depression may struggle to complete daily tasks or feel fatigued and unmotivated.
At work, they may struggle to concentrate on projects.
Symptoms can also lead to problems in social relationships as well.

Follow Now: Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / RSS     Differential Diagnosis    Your doctor will also want to rule out other mental health conditions that can cause symptoms of depression.
Such conditions include:    Persistent depressive disorders (dysthymia): This type of depression is less severe than major depression but tends to be longer-lasting.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD): This condition involves symptoms of depression that are experienced the week before and during a menstrual cycle.
Bipolar disorders: Bipolar I and II are marked by mood swings that include periods of depression.
Distinguishing Between Moderate and Severe Depression    While there is no clear consensus on how to rate the severity of depression, one study found that DSM-5 diagnostic criteria could be used to infer the severity of the condition.6      Depressed mood along with the presence of somatic symptoms was an indicator of moderate depression.
People with moderate depression are more likely to experience primary symptoms of low mood, sleep difficulties, weight or appetite changes, and increased/slowed psychomotor activity.
Anhedonia (the loss of interest or pleasure) along with non-somatic symptoms was an indicator of severe depression.
Along with losing interest in things that used to be pleasurable, people with severe depression are more likely to experience symptoms such as feelings of worthlessness and thoughts of death.
Causes    Depression is very common.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is the leading cause of ill health and disability globally.7    There is no single thing that causes depression.
In reality, there are a number of factors that are thought to contribute to the onset of depression.
Sex is one factor that can play a role since women experience depression at about twice the rate of men.
Other things that can contribute to depression include:    GeneticsHaving parents or other family members with depressionHaving another mental health conditionPovertyChronic health conditionsCertain medications    How Cognitive Distortions Fuel Depression      Treatments    Moderately severe depression may be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.
Psychotherapy    Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of therapy that is often used to treat depression.
CBT focuses on identifying negative thoughts that contribute to symptoms of depression.
Once these thought patterns have been identified, people then work to replace those thoughts with more positive and realistic ways of thinking.
CBT tends to be a shorter-term approach to therapy, so it may involve somewhere between 10 and 20 sessions.
During this time, you will also be expected to do homework outside of your therapy sessions.
This might involve practicing skills that you have learned during therapy as well as keeping a record of your symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors.
Examples of types of thinking that can contribute to symptoms of moderate depression include:    Overgeneralization, which involves applying one experience to all future experiences.
Automatic negative thoughts, which are types of thoughts that are self-defeating and irrational.
All-or-nothing thinking, which involves thinking of things in absolute terms.
This type of thinking causes people to see themselves in terms of extremes, either as successes or failures with no room for anything in between.
Ignoring or discounting positive experiences, which involves only focusing on the negative things that happen while not paying attention to the good things.
Magnifying problems, which can involve blowing up even small problems into much more serious issues than they really are.
Taking things personally, which can lead to feelings of blame, regret, or resentment.
Through journaling, you can begin to become more aware of these thought patterns and practice new ways of thinking about your experiences and problems.
It can also help you replace negative self-talk with more positive self-talk.
Other types of therapy that can be used to treat moderately severe depression include:    Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT): This approach is a form of CBT that focuses on helping people with depression learn to tolerate distress, regulate their emotions, and improve their relationships with others.
Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This approach focuses on understanding how relationships with others can impact depression.
People then work to improve these social relationships and resolve existing conflicts.Psychodynamic therapy: This form of talk therapy, sometimes known as psychoanalytic therapy, focuses on helping people identify unconscious and unresolved conflicts that lead to troubling feelings.
Online therapy may also be a good option for some people with moderately severe depression.
One study found that guided internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) was effective for reducing symptoms of mild to moderate depression.8   How to Choose the Best Type of Therapy to Treat Your Depression     Medications    There are a number of different types of antidepressants that can be used to treat moderately severe depression.
The most commonly prescribed are known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
These include medications like Zoloft (sertraline), Prozac (fluoxetine), and Paxil (paroxetine).
While SSRIs are usually the preferred choice because they tend to have fewer side effects, other medications are sometimes prescribed.
Other types of antidepressants include serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), atypical antidepressants, and tricyclic antidepressants.
All antidepressants carry a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black box warning that their use may cause worsening symptoms and increased suicidal ideation in children, teens, and young adults under the age of 25.
Complementary and Alternative Treatments    There are some alternative remedies that may be helpful for some people who have mild to moderate depression.
St. John's wort, for example, is one herbal supplement that is sometimes used to help alleviate symptoms of mild to moderate depression.
While the supplement is not FDA-approved for the treatment of depression, some research suggests that it may help reduce symptoms.9    Because St. John's wort affects serotonin levels in the brain, it can lead to a serious condition known as serotonin syndrome.
It can also interact with other medications, including antidepressants.
You should always talk to your doctor before trying any complementary treatment such as St. John's wort.
Does St. John's Wort Have Any Drug Interactions With Antidepressants?
Coping    While antidepressants are the most effective choice for people who have severe depression, lifestyle modifications may be a helpful choice for people who have more mild or moderate symptoms.
Get Regular Exercise    Regular physical activity has been shown to help prevent and treat depression.
Studies have even shown that exercise can be an effective first-line treatment in cases of mild to moderate depression.10    The good news is that you don't have to become a gym devotee to reap these depression-fighting rewards.
Moderate physical activity, such as walking for a total of three hours a week, can help.
Manage Stress Levels    Stress can contribute to and worsen symptoms of moderately severe depression, so finding ways to relax and manage your stress levels can be helpful.
One way to do this is to focus on relaxation techniques designed to improve your ability to tolerate and manage distressing emotions.
When faced with distress, people often rely on unhelpful coping mechanisms that can worsen symptoms of depression.
Some more helpful strategies include yoga, deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness.
Take Care of Yourself    Practicing good self-care can be helpful when coping with symptoms of depression.
It is important to remember, however, that depressive symptoms can often make taking care of yourself more difficult.
Feeling fatigued, unmotivated, disinterested, and distracted can interfere with normal daily tasks.
While it may require extra effort, doing some of the following can help you feel better:    Eat a healthy diet Seek out social support Engage in activities you enjoy    Try to avoid isolating yourself when you are feeling down.
Depression often causes people to withdraw from friends and loved ones, but reaching out to the people who care about you can actually help reduce feelings of depression.
If you or a loved one are struggling with depression, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.
